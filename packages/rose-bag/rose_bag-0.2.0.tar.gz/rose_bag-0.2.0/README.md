# ROSE - Yet Another ROS Bag Filter Tool

A high-performance ROS bag filtering tool that allows you to extract specific topics from ROSv1 bag files. Built with C++ core and Python interface, it provides both command-line and TUI interfaces for efficient bag file processing.

## Aesthetic 

> The cassette tape, a modest analog artifact, has evolved into a retro-futurism icon, demonstrating that technological advancement can coexist with human touch. Its tactile interface and physical limitations serve as poignant reminders of our technological heritage.

> 磁带盒不仅是一种技术遗物，更是复古未来主义的艺术品和精神图腾。简单的按钮、褪色的塑料外壳和有限的存储容量，既是怀旧的载体，也是对数字霸权的温柔反抗。它时刻提醒着我们：技术的突飞猛进不应该以牺牲人性为代价，克制的设计往往更能打动人心。

The TUI embraces the **cassette futurism** aesthetic - a design philosophy that reimagines future interfaces through the lens of 20th century technological fossils. This intentional retrofuturism features:

- **Nostalgic minimalism**: Low-resolution displays and monochromatic schemes that evoke 1980s computing
- **Tactile authenticity**: Visual metaphors of physical media like magnetic tapes and CRT textures
- **Humanized technology**: Warm color palettes and "imperfect" interfaces that resist digital sterility

More than mere retro styling, this approach serves as poetic resistance to digital hegemony. The cassette tape - our central metaphor - embodies this duality:

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Install rose-bag from pypi
```bash
pip install rose-bag
```

2. Install from the source
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/hanxiaomax/rose.git
cd rose

# Run the installation script
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

To uninstall Rose, run the following command:
```bash
pip uninstall rose-bag
```

### Terminal Setup

To ensure proper color display in your terminal, set the following environment variable:
```bash
# Add this to your bashrc or zshrc
export TERM=xterm-256color
```

No ROS bag file? No problem! Download [webviz demo.bag](https://storage.googleapis.com/cruise-webviz-public/demo.bag) and give it a try!

> [!NOTE]
> Want to try C++ Parser instead of [Python API(lib rosbag)](https://wiki.ros.org/rosbag/Code%20API#Python_API)?
> 
> Since Rose's C++ parser depends on [ROS Noetic](https://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation) environment, you need to install it first.
>
> Option 1: Install ROS Noetic (Ubuntu 20.04), refer to [ROS Noetic Installation](http://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation)
>
> Option 2: Use docker image
> 1. Build the Docker image:
>    ```bash
>    cd docker
>    docker build -t rose .
>    ```
> 2. Run the container:
>    ```bash
>    ./go_docker.sh
>    ```
> Once you have ros environment installed, you can build `rosbag_io_py` lib which is required by roseApp to operate.
> 1. Build the ROS project:
>    ```bash
>    cd ros
>    ./build.sh
>    ```
> 2. Set up environment which will make sure `rosbag_io_py` add to `PYTHONPATH`
>    ```bash
>    source setup.sh
>    ```
> **You are all set! Now you can use RoseApp to filter ROS bag files.**
>
> Note: Rose's C++ parser is very simple and not support ROS2. It is slightly faster than Python API(lib rosbag) (Refer to [benchmark](./benchmark/README.md)). But I am not sure if it is worth the effort to maintain it.




## Usage

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you experience color display issues in your terminal, set the following environment variable:
> ```bash
> export TERM=xterm-256color
> ```
> This ensures proper color rendering in both CLI and TUI interfaces.

### Command Line Interface

Rose provides several command-line tools for bag file operations:


1. Analyze topics and create whitelist:
   ```bash
   # Show all topics in the bag file
   ./rose.py inspect input.bag

   # Filter topics by pattern and show
   ./rose.py inspect input.bag -p ".*gps.*"

   # Filter topics and save to whitelist
   ./rose.py inspect input.bag -p ".*sensor.*" -s sensor_whitelist.txt

   # Output in JSON format
   ./rose.py inspect input.bag --json
   ```

2. Filter bag file:
   ```bash
   # Filter using whitelist file
   ./rose.py filter input.bag output.bag -w whitelist.txt

   # Filter by specific topics
   ./rose.py filter input.bag output.bag --topics /topic1 --topics /topic2

   # Filter by time range
   ./rose.py filter input.bag output.bag -w whitelist.txt -t "23/01/01 00:00:00,23/01/01 00:10:00"

   # Dry run to preview changes
   ./rose.py filter input.bag output.bag -w whitelist.txt --dry-run
   ```

Common workflow example:
```bash
# 1. First inspect the bag file
./rose.py info demo.bag

# 2. Create a whitelist with GPS related topics
./rose.py inspect demo.bag -p ".*gps.*" -s gps_whitelist.txt

# 3. Filter the bag file using the whitelist
./rose.py filter demo.bag gps_only.bag -w gps_whitelist.txt
```

### TUI Interface

To launch the TUI:
```bash
python3 rose.py tui
```

2. Some key bindings:
   - `q`: to quit
   - `f`: to filter bag files
   - `w`: to load whitelist
   - `s`: to save whitelist
   - `a`: to toggle select all topics

#### Configuration

Rose is configured with `roseApp/config.json`.
```json
{
    "show_splash_screen": true,
    "theme": "cassette-walkman",
    "load_cpp_parser": false,
    "whitelists": {
        "demo": "./whitelists/demo.txt",
        "radar": "./whitelists/radar.txt",
        "invalid": "./whitelists/invalid.txt"
    }
}
```

- `show_splash_screen`: whether to show the splash screen, default is true
- `theme`: the theme of the TUI, default is `cassette-walkman`, check [Theme](#theme) for more details
- `load_cpp_parser`: whether to use C++ implementation for better performance, default is false
- `whitelists`: the whitelists of the TUI, default is empty, check [Whitelist](#whitelist) for more details

> [!NOTE]
> The `load_cpp_parser` option is set to false by default to improve startup time. Enable it only if you need better performance and have the C++ implementation properly installed.

#### Theme
RoseApp TUI provides two built-in themes: `cassette-walkman` (default light theme) and `cassette-dark`. You can configure the theme in two ways:

| cassette-walkman | cassette-dark |
|------------|-------------|
| ![Light Theme TUI](main-light.png) | ![Dark Theme TUI](main-dark.png) |

1. Modify `config.json` to specify your preferred theme:

```json
{
    "theme": "cassette-dark",
}
```
2. Switch Theme in TUI with command palette(the buttom in bottom right corner or keybinding ^p)


#### Whitelist

You can filter bag files with pre-configured whitelist. To select pre-configured whitelists, press `w` in TUI. But before that, you need to create your own whitelist.

You can create your own whitelist in 3 ways:

1. Create topic whitelist from command line:
   ```bash
   ./rose.py inspect input.bag | awk '{print $1}' > whitelist/example.txt
   ```

2. Create topic whitelist with your favorite text editor and save it to `whitelist/`:

3. Create topic in TUI by press `s` to save current selected topics as whitelist file to `whitelist/` directory:

After whitelist created, add it to `config.json` so RoseApp can find it:
```json
{
    "whitelists": {
        "demo": "./whitelists/demo.txt",
        "radar": "./whitelists/radar.txt",
        "invalid": "./whitelists/invalid.txt"
    }
}
```

> - [Event and Messages](https://textual.textualize.io/guide/events/) are also important ideas to understand how Textual works so you can handle [actions](https://textual.textualize.io/guide/actions/)
> - Thanks to [Workers](https://textual.textualize.io/guide/workers/), asynchronous operations never been so easy. it can supppot asyncio or threads.
