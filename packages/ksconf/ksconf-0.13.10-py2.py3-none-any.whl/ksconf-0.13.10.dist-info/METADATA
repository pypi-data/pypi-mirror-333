# Ksconf Splunk CONFiguration tool

This utility handles common Splunk app maintenance tasks in an installable python package.
Specifically, this tool deals with many of the nuances of storing Splunk apps in a
version control system like git and pointing live Splunk apps to a working tree. Merging changes
from the live system's (local) folder to the version controlled (default) folder and dealing with
more than one layer of "default" are all supported tasks which are not native to Splunk.
Tasks like creating new Splunk apps from your local system while merging the 'local' folder into
'default' is also supported.

Earlier version of this project were packaged as [kintyre-splunk-conf](https://pypi.org/project/kintyre-splunk-conf) prior to v0.10.0
