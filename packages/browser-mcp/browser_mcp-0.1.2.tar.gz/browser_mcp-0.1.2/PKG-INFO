# browser-mcp

A MCP (Model Control Protocol) server for [browser-use](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use) library. This package allows AI agents to perform web browsing tasks through a standardized interface.

## Installation

You can install the package using pip:

```bash
pip install browser-mcp
```

Or with uv (recommended):

```bash
uv pip install browser-mcp
```

After installation, you'll need to install Playwright's browser dependencies:

```bash
playwright install
```

Alternatively, you can use the `browser-mcp-run` command which will automatically install these dependencies if they're missing.

## Setup

For development, clone the repository and install in development mode:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/pranav7/browser-mcp.git
cd browser-mcp

# Install dependencies with uv
uv pip install -e .

# Or with pip
pip install -e .
```

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file with your OpenAI API key:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## Usage

### Running the MCP Server

#### In Development Mode

When working with the package in development mode, you can run it directly with Python:

```bash
mcp dev browser_mcp/server.py
```

#### In Production

After installing the package from PyPI, you can run it with uvx:

```bash
uvx browser-mcp
```

The package is specifically designed to work with uvx, which allows for more efficient package loading and execution.

#### With Automatic Dependency Check

You can also use the `browser-mcp-run` command, which checks for and installs Playwright dependencies automatically before starting the server:

```bash
browser-mcp-run
```

This ensures that all required Playwright browsers are installed on your system.

### Using as a Client

```python
from mcp.client import Client

async def main():
    client = await Client.connect()

    # Perform a task with the browser
    result = await client.rpc("perform_task_with_browser",
                             task="Search for the latest news about AI and summarize the top 3 results")
    print(result)

    await client.close()
```

### Programmatic Usage

You can also use the package programmatically:

```python
# In development mode
from src import run

# In production (after installing the package)
# from browser_mcp import run

# Run the MCP server with stdio transport
run(transport="stdio")

# Or with SSE transport
# run(transport="sse")
```

## Available RPC Methods

- `search_web(task: str, model: str = "gpt-4o-mini")` - Performs basic web searches using browser-use Agent. The `model` parameter is optional and defaults to "gpt-4o-mini".
- `search_web_with_planning(task: str, base_model: str = "gpt-4o-mini", planning_model: str = "o3-mini")` - Performs complex web searches that require planning. Uses a planner LLM for better task decomposition. Both `base_model` and `planning_model` parameters are optional with their respective defaults.

## Development

### Testing

Tests can be run with:

```bash
python -m unittest discover
```

You can also test the package functionality with:

```bash
python test_uvx.py
```

This script will:
1. Test importing the package directly (development mode)
2. Attempt to run it with uvx (production mode)

Note: The uvx test may fail in development mode unless the package is published to PyPI. This is expected behavior.

### Publishing to PyPI

This project uses GitHub Actions to automatically publish to PyPI when a new release is created. The workflow:

1. Builds the package using uv
2. Publishes it to PyPI using trusted publishing

To create a new release:

1. Update the version in `pyproject.toml`
2. Create a new release on GitHub
3. The GitHub Action will automatically build and publish the package
