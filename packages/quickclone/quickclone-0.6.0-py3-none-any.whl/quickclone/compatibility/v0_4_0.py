    Fix for v0.4.0 or below.
    
    Prompt user to move or copy cache from `~/.cache/quicktoml` to
    `~/.cache/quickclone`, then perform an operation based on the user's choice.
    See #Returns for what operations are available.
    The main logic of this function should only be activated if
    `~/.cache/quickclone` is not detected and `~/.cache/quicktoml` is non-empty.
    
    Returns
    -------
    status: int
        The status code indicates what operation was performed.
        0: Nothing had to be done, the cache folder is already at
            `~/.cache/quickclone` or if `~/.cache/quicktoml` was not detected.
        1: User didn't want to move `~/.cache/quicktoml` to
            `~/.cache/quickclone`.
        2: User moved `~/.cache/quicktoml` to `~/.cache/quickclone`.
        3: User copied `~/.cache/quicktoml` to `~/.cache/quickclone`.
