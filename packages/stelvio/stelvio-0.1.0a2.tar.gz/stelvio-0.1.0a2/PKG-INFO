# Stelvio

_**AWS for Python devs - made simple.**_

[**Documentation**](https://docs.stelvio.dev/getting-started/quickstart/)

## What is Stelvio?

Stelvio is a Python library that simplifies cloud infrastructure management and deployment. It lets you define your cloud infrastructure using pure Python, with smart defaults that handle complex configuration automatically.

### Key Features

- **Python-Native Infrastructure**: Define your cloud resources using familiar Python code
- **Smart Defaults**: Automatic configuration of IAM roles, networking, and security
- **Clean Separation**: Keep your infrastructure code separate from application code
- **Developer-First**: Built specifically for Python developers, not infrastructure experts

### Currently Supported

- AWS Lambda
- Amazon DynamoDB
- API Gateway
- Linking - automated IAM

*Support for additional AWS services is planned.*

## Quick Start

Go to our [Quick Start Guide](https://docs.stelvio.dev/getting-started/quickstart/) to start

## Why Stelvio?

Unlike generic infrastructure tools like Terraform, Pulumi, or AWS CDK, Stelvio is:

- Built specifically for Python developers
- Focused on developer productivity, not infrastructure complexity
- Designed to minimize boilerplate through intelligent defaults
- Maintained in pure Python without mixing application and infrastructure code

## Project Status

Stelvio is currently in active development as a side project. 

⚠️ It is in Early alpha state - Not production ready - Only for experimentation - API unstable"

It supports basic Lambda, Dynamo DB and API Gateway setup.

## Contributing

Best way to contribute now is to play with it and report any issues.

I'm also happy to gather any feedback or feature requests.
