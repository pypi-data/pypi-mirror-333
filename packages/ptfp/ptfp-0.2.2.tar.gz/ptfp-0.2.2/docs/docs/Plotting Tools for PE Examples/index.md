# Example Usage

A few examples are presented for using `ptfp`.

In the first, [Working with Bilby Components](./0_bilby_building_blocks) we actually do not utilize `ptfp`, but rather introduce many core concepts for post-processing with bilby which are not introduced in the standard ODW tutorials.

In [Spectrograms](./1_spectrograms.ipynb) we use `ptfp` to make spectrograms of the data, and add a posterior time-frequency reconstruction. 

In [Timeseries](./2_timeseries.ipynb) we use `ptfp` to plot the whitened time domain strain, and the posterior waveform reconstruction.
