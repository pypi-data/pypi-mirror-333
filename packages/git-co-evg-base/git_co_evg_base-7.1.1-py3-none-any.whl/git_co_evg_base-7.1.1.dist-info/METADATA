## Description

When running an Evergreen patch build, it can be useful that base your
changes on a commit in which the tests in Evergreen have already been run.
This way if you encounter any failures in your patch build, you can easily
compare the failure with what was seen in the base commit to understand if
your changes may have introduced the failure.

This command allows you to specify criteria to use to find a
git commit to start work from.

## Documentation

Documentation can be found [here](https://evergreen-ci.github.io/git-co-evg-base/).

## Dependencies

* Python 3.9 or later
* git
* [Evergreen config file](https://github.com/evergreen-ci/evergreen/wiki/Using-the-Command-Line-Tool#downloading-the-command-line-tool)
* [Evergreen CLI](https://github.com/evergreen-ci/evergreen/wiki/Using-the-Command-Line-Tool#downloading-the-command-line-tool)

## Installation

We strongly recommend using a tool like [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/) to install
this tool. This will isolate the dependencies and ensure they don't conflict with other tools.

```bash
$ pipx install git-co-evg-base
```

### Debugging installation issues

A common issue that arises during installation is pipx failing to install git-co-evg-base and printing out the following error:
```bash
$ pipx install git-co-evg-base
Fatal error from pip prevented installation. Full pip output in file:
    /home/ubuntu/.local/pipx/logs/cmd_2022-03-31_13.24.42_pip_errors.log

Some possibly relevant errors from pip install:
    ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement git-co-evg-base (from versions: none)
    ERROR: No matching distribution found for git-co-evg-base

Error installing git-co-evg-base.
```

This error indicates that pipx could not find a version of git-co-evg-base that was built to support the version of Python installed on your machine.
Make sure to check that your version of Python matches the requirements called out in the [Dependencies](#dependencies) section. You
can check the version of Python that is on your computer by running
```bash
$ python --version
```

If you are running into the issue above but are sure that the correct version of Python is installed on your computer,
you can explicitly specify a path to the correct Python version during installation.

```bash
$ which python3.9
/usr/bin/python3.9
$ pipx install git-co-evg-base --python /usr/bin/python3.9
```

## Usage

Detailed usage documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/evergreen-ci/git-co-evg-base/tree/main/docs/usage.md).

```
Usage: git-co-evg-base [OPTIONS]

  Find and perform git actions on a recent commit that matches the specified criteria.

  When running an Evergreen patch build, it can be useful that base your changes on a commit in
  which the tests in Evergreen have already been run. This way if you encounter any failures in
  your patch build, you can easily compare the failure with what was seen in the base commit to
  understand if your changes may have introduced the failure.

  This command allows you to specify criteria to use to find a git commit to start work from.

  Criteria

  There are 5 criteria that can be specified:

  * The percentage of tasks that have passed in each build.

  * The percentage of tasks that have failed in each build.

  * The percentage of tasks that have run in each build.

  * Specific tasks that must have passed in each build (if they are part of that build).

  * Specific tasks that must have run in each build (if they are part of that build).

  If no criteria are specified, a success threshold of 0.95 will be used and the other 4 above
  options will be null.

  Additionally, you can specify which build variants the criteria should be checked against. By
  default, all build variants will be checked.

  Notes

  If you have any evergreen modules with local checkouts in the location specified in your
  project's evergreen.yml configuration file. They will automatically be checked out to the
  revision that was run in Evergreen with the revision of the base project.

  Examples

  Working on a fix for a task 'replica_sets_jscore_passthrough' on the build variants '! Amazon
  Linux 2 arm64 (all feature flags)' and '! Enterprise Windows (all feature flags)', to ensure the
  task has been run on those build variants:

      git co-evg-base --run-task replica_sets_jscore_passthrough --display-variant-name "^! Amazon Linux 2 arm64 (all feature flags)$" --display-variant-name "^! Enterprise Windows (all feature flags)$"

  Starting a new change, to ensure that there are no systemic failures on the base commit:

      git co-evg-base --pass-threshold 0.98

Options:
  --passing-task TEXT             Specify a task that needs to be passing (can be specified
                                  multiple times).

  --run-threshold FLOAT           Specify the percentage of tasks that need to be run.
  --pass-threshold FLOAT          Specify the percentage of tasks that need to be successful.

```

Checkout with successful tasks 'auth' and 'auth_audit' on builds '! Enterprise Windows (all feature flags)'

```bash
$ git co-evg-base --passing-task auth --passing-task auth_audit --run-threshold 0.95 --display-variant-name "^! Enterprise Windows (all feature flags)$" --display-variant-name "^! Amazon Linux 2 arm64 (all feature flags)$"
