    "Welcome to the `biprop` tutorial. In this module, we will demonstrate the basic usage of the `biprop` library on the example from [this Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biproportional_apportionment#Specific_example). If you have not yet heard about biproportional apportionment, it might be a good idea to have a quick look at that Wikipedia page first.\n",

    "There are different ways to calculate the upper apportionment. Often, the upper apportionment is not even calculated based on the votes, but rather is some predefined distribution that was calculated based on something else (e.g. the population of the regions). Whenever we call the `biproportional_apportionment` or the `lower_apportionment` methods, we need to specify how we want the upper apportionment to be calculated or whether we want to use a predefined distribution. The last time, we specified this implicitly through calling the `upper_apportionment` method. This time, we need to mention it explicilty through the `party_seats` and `region_seats` arguments. The Wikipedia example uses the Sainte-Laguë method for the upper apportionment. This method corresponds to arithmetic rounding (for an overview, which method corresponds to which rounding method, see [this Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highest_averages_method#Specific_methods)). We therefore specify that we want to use the Sainte-Laguë method by passing `np.round` to the method (we have to use `np.round` instead of the standard `round` since the rounding function needs to be able to handle `numpy`-arrays). We can therefore use the following code:"
