This module extends the functionality of quality_control_oca to edit the
flux of quality inspections to always pass through the "Waiting
supervisor approval" state.

Without this module, correct quality inspections dont pass through the
waiting state. With this module all inspections will pass through the
waiting state.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

1. Configure a quality test
2. In the product form or product category form, associate the quality
   test to a product for a quality trigger (example: incoming pickings)
3. Execute the trigger to create the quality inspection (example: create
   a incoming picking for the configured product)
4. Go to the quality inspection and Validate it. Its state will became
   "Waiting supervisor approval" even if the inspection is correct
