## v2.1.0 - What's new

- 20 level market depth is now available on DhanHQ APIs and part of the python library.

DhanHQ v2.1.0 is more modular and secure.

- The project is restructured to contemporary "best practices" in the python world. How does this affect you? Your imports would change like below:


  | Before This Version                                                    | After This Release                               |
  |------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
  | from dhanhq import dhanhq | from dhanhq import dhanhq |
  | from dhanhq import marketfeed.MarketFeed | from dhanhq import MarketFeed |
  | from dhanhq import orderupdate.OrderUpdate | from dhanhq import OrderUpdate |

- The constants that were earlier part of modules `marketfeed` and `orderupdate` are now moved to its respective classes contained in the modules for better developer experience. 

  | Before This Version | After This Release |
  |---------------------|--------------------|
  | marketfeed.NSE      | MarketFeed.NSE       |
  | marketfeed.Ticker | MarketFeed.Ticker |

  Note: This improves developer experience to not knowing the entire package hierarchy and stay productive to know the interfaces he is working with. 


- You no longer have to repeat and spread the `client-id` and `access-token` around their code based in using our APIs. With this release, you defined it once for `DhanContext` and pass on this to different classes of the SDK instead of the raw credential strings, making your codebase much secure from data leaks and your coding a lot easier by defining DhanContext just once and use that context for other API classes. Quick glance of how affected code initialization is below:

  | Before This Version                                | After This Release                   |
  |----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
  | `dhanhq('client_id','access_token')`               | `dhanhq('dhan_context')`              |
  | `MarketFeed('client_id','access_token',instruments)` | `MarketFeed('dhan_context',instruments)` |
  | `OrderUpdate('client_id','access_token')`          | `OrderUpdate('dhan_context')`         |

  **Note:** The **_Hands-on API_** section is updated to reflect this change, for your convenience.

- Code coverage improvements with robust unit & integration tests for safe and speed delivery of features. Will strengthen even more in upcoming releases.

## v2.0 - What's New

DhanHQ v2 extends execution capability with live order updates, market quotes and forever orders on superfast APIs. Some of the key highlights from this version are:
    
- Fetch LTP, Quote (with OI) and Market Depth data directly on API, for upto 1000 instruments at once with Market Quote API.

- Option Chain API which gives OI, greeks, volume, top bid/ask and price data of all strikes of a particular underlying.

- Place, modify and manage your Forever Orders, including single and OCO orders to manage risk and trade efficiently with Forever Order API.

- Order Updates are sent in real time via websockets, which will update order status of all your orders placed via any platform - `order_update`.

- Intraday Minute Data now provides OHLC with Volume data for last 5 trading days across timeframes such as 1 min, 5 min, 15 min, 25 min and 60 min - `intraday_minute_data`.

- Full Packet in Live Market Feed (`marketfeed`).

- Margin Calculator (`margin_calculator`) and Kill Switch (`kill_switch`) APIs.

```python
from dhanhq import DhanContext, MarketFeed

# Define and use your dhan_context if you haven't already done so like below:
dhan_context = DhanContext("client_id","access_token")

# Structure for subscribing is (exchange_segment, "security_id", subscription_type)

instruments = [(MarketFeed.NSE, "1333", MarketFeed.Ticker),   # Ticker - Ticker Data
    (MarketFeed.NSE, "1333", MarketFeed.Quote),     # Quote - Quote Data
    (MarketFeed.NSE, "1333", MarketFeed.Full),      # Full - Full Packet

    (MarketFeed.NSE, "11915", MarketFeed.Full)]

version = "v2"          # Mention Version and set to latest version 'v2'

# In case subscription_type is left as blank, by default Ticker mode will be subscribed.

try:
    data = MarketFeed(dhan_context, instruments, version)
    while True:
        data.run_forever()
        response = data.get_data()
        print(response)

except Exception as e:
    print(e)
```

```
# Close Connection
data.disconnect()

# Subscribe instruments while connection is open
sub_instruments = [(MarketFeed.NSE, "14436", MarketFeed.Ticker)]

data.subscribe_symbols(sub_instruments)
