# Molass Library

<font color="orange">WARNING: This package is currently in preparation to be available in April, 2025.</font>

Molass Library is a rewrite of [MOLASS](https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/biophysico/20/1/20_e200001/_article), an analytical tool for SEC-SAXS experiment data currently ported at [Photon Factory](https://pfwww.kek.jp/saxs/MOLASS.html). It is designed to be suitable for scripting in Jupyter notebooks, thereby obtaining greater flexibility compared to the predecessor thanks to the Python ecosystem diversity.

To install this package, you can use pip as follows.

```
pip install -U molass
```
