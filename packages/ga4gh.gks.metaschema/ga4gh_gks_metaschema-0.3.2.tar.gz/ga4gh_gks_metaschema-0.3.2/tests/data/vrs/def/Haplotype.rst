      - :ref:`Adjacency` | :ref:`Allele` | :ref:`IRI`
      - 2..m
      - A list of :ref:`Alleles <Allele>` and :ref:`Adjacencies <Adjacency>` that comprise a Haplotype. Members must share the same reference sequence as adjacent members. Alleles should not have overlapping or adjacent coordinates with neighboring Alleles. Neighboring alleles should be ordered by ascending coordinates, unless represented on a DNA inversion (following an Adjacency with end-defined adjoinedSequences), in which case they should be ordered in descending coordinates. Sequence references MUST be consistent for all members between and including the end of one Adjacency and the beginning of another.
