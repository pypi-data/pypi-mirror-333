# PingSSS - A tool to ping multiple hosts concurrently

PingSSS is a powerful command-line tool designed to ping multiple hosts concurrently. It's perfect for network diagnostics and testing, allowing you to efficiently monitor the status of numerous devices simultaneously.

## Features
* Concurrent Pinging: Ping multiple hosts at the same time to save time and effort.
* IP Range Parsing: Easily parse and ping a range of IP addresses with a simple command.
* Filter Results: Display only alive or dead hosts based on your preference.
* JSON Output: Save the results in JSON format for further analysis.

## Installation

To install PingSSS, use pip:
```
pip install pingsss
```

Alternatively, you can run PingSSS without installation using uvx:
```
uvx pingsss
```

## Usage

PingSSS is easy to use with straightforward commands. Here's a basic example:
```
ping-tool 192.168.100.1-20 --output json --show alive
```

This command will ping the IP range 192.168.100.1 to 192.168.100.20, output the results in JSON format, and display only the alive hosts.
