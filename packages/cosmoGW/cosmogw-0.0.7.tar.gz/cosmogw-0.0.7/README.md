* Author: Alberto Roper Pol (alberto.roperpol@unige.ch)
* Created: 20/02/2025 (moved from [AlbertoRoper/cosmoGW](https://github.com/AlbertoRoper/cosmoGW) created on 19/07/2023, which is an extension of [AlbertoRoper/GW_turbulence](https://github.com/AlbertoRoper/GW_turbulence) from 01/11/2021)
  
CosmoGW (an extended update including [*GW_turbulence*](https://github.com/AlbertoRoper/GW_turbulence)) is a project to produce results related to the production of COSMOlogical Gravitational Wave backgrounds (CosmoGW) from different sources in the early Universe (e.g., sound waves and MHD turbulence produced during cosmological phase transitions).

The project includes state-of-the-art GW models developed by the community, postprocessing calculations, numerical computations, plotting routines, and detector sensitivities.

If you use any of the cosmoGW results, please cite this [repository](https://github.com/MHDcosmoGW/cosmoGW) and the relevant reference/s listed in the routines, corresponding to the original published work. I would also love to hear about your interest for this project and your work, so consider reaching me out on my email: alberto.roperpol@unige.ch.

If you have any issues, comments, suggestions, or you are just interested in discussing any of the presented results, you are more than welcome to contact me by email.

Some of the routines use results from large-scale numerical simulations using the open-source [Pencil Code](https://github.com/pencil-code);

Open Source Softw. **6**, 2807 (2021), [arXiv:2009.08231](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.08231), [DOI:10.21105/joss.02807](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.02807).

In particular, if you use any of the results that involve Pencil Code simulations, please cite the [Pencil Code paper](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.02807) and the [code](https://github.com/pencil-code).

## Routines

The main routines of cosmoGW are:

* [**cosmoGW.py**](cosmoGW.py): functions relevant for cosmological stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds (SGWB).
* [**cosmology.py**](cosmology.py): functions relevant for cosmological calculations, including a Friedmann equations solver (see tutorial on Friedmann equations in [cosmology.ipnyb](cosmology/cosmology.ipynb)) that can generate the solution files being read in some Pencil Code simulations (see tutorial [cosmology_PC.ipnyb](cosmology/cosmology_PC.ipynb)).
* [**cosmoMF.py**](cosmoMF.py): functions relevant for cosmological magnetic fields like bounds from different experiments, observations or projected sensitivities, and expectations from theory, among others.
* [**GW_analytical.py**](GW_analytical.py)
* [**GW_fopt.py**](GW_fopt.py)
* [**hydro_bubbles.py**](hydro_bubbles.py): functions to compute fluid perturbations induced by the expansion of bubbles in first-order phase transitions
* [**interferometry.py**](interferometry.py): functions to compute the response and sensitivity functions of interferometer space-based GW detectors (e.g., LISA and Taiji) to the detection of SGWBs (see tutorial on LISA interferometry in [interferometry.ipynb](interferometry/interferometry.ipynb)) energy density and polarization, including the space-based network LISA-Taiji to detect polarization.
* [**modified_grav.py**](modified_grav.py): functions relevant for GW production in the context of general theories of modified gravity.
* [**pta.py**](pta.py): functions used in the analysis of observations by pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations: NANOGrav, PPTA, EPTA, and IPTA.
* [**reading.py**](reading.py): functions to read the output files of a specific set of runs (project) of the Pencil Code.
* [**run.py**](run.py): contains the class **run**, used to store all the variables computed in the Pencil Code and in cosmoGW from the Pencil Code solitions. It includes functions to initialize and postprocess the results of a set of runs.
* [**spectra.py**](spectra.py): contains description for specific spectral templates, postprocessing routines for numerical spectra, and other mathematical routines.

Some data files are available in cosmoGW that are useful in some of the projects:
* [**cosmology**](cosmology): includes files relevant for the cosmological evolution of the Universe and contains a tutorial on solving Friedmann equations.
* [**interferometry**](interferometry): includes files relevant for space-based GW interferometry calculations and contains a tutorial on computing the response functions, sensitivities and power law sensitivities to SGWB energy density and polarization.
* [**detector_sensitivity**](detector_sensitivity): includes the sensitivity of various detectors (ground-based, space-based, and pulsar timing arrays, among others), see the [README](detector_sensitivity/README.md) file for info and references.

## Projects

* [**GWs_from_PTs**](projects/GWs_from_PTs): contains tutorials related to the production of GWs (self-similar profiles calculation for now, but more coming soon!)
