## GraphSense
GraphSense is a framework that can be used to easily train and use code suggestion models with minimal data preprocessing and resource consumption. No transformers are used and underlying algorithm used was Node2Vec. FAISS used as the vector index and RocksDB used to store code line to index and index to code line mappings.

GraphSense is highly optimized for performance and efficiency.

### Requirements

* Python 3.8 or greater


### installation:
```
pip install graphsense
```


### Training example:

```
from graphsense import GraphTrain

g = GraphTrain()
# train the model
g.line_completion(directory_path="code_files", language="Python")
```

### Inference example:

```
from graphsense import GraphInfer

g = GraphInfer()

g.load_artifacts()  # load the artifacts to memory
suggestions = g.infer("def factorial(n):")
g.unload_artifacts()  # clean memory

print("top 10 suggestions: ", suggestions)
```
