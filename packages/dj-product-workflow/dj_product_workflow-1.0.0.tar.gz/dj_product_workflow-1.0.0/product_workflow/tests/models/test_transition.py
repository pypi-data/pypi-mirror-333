    Tests for the Transition model.

    -------
    - test_str_representation: Verifies the __str__ method returns the expected format.
    - test_str_with_missing_steps: Tests __str__ when steps are missing.
    - test_clean_valid_instance: Tests that clean passes with a valid instance.
    - test_clean_auto_sets_product_workflow: Tests that clean sets product_workflow automatically.
    - test_clean_missing_steps: Tests that clean raises ValidationError for missing steps.
    - test_clean_mismatched_workflows: Tests that clean raises ValidationError for mismatched workflows.
    - test_clean_duplicate_transition: Tests that clean raises ValidationError for duplicates.
    - test_unique_constraint: Verifies the database-level unique constraint.
