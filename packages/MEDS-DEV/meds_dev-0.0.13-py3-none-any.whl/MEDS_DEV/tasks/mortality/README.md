# Mortality Prediction

This folder contains tasks for predicting mortality in patients in a variety of clinical contexts. Mortality
is a common prediciton target because

1. The "death" label is unambiguous, clearly important, and (often) easy to collect.
2. Mortality is a common outcome in clinical research, and many studies have collected data that can be used
    to predict mortality.
3. Mortality prediction within specific time-frames can be used as a proxy for the need for greater clinical
    attention on select patients, and mortality has accordingly been used as a training proxy for the
    development of clinical risk scores in various settings. We do not advocate this use of mortality in all
    contexts, but it is a common use-case for mortality prediction tasks.
