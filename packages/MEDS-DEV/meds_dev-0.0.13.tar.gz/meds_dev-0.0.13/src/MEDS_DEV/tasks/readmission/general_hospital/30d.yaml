    This file specifies the base configuration for the prediction of readmission to the hospital within the
    first 30 days of discharge. There is **no** imposed gap window between the discharge and the target
    readmission window. To avoid censoring, this task _requires patients to have data more than 30 days out_
    from the hospital discharge. This ensures that patients who have not had a readmission _yet_ but will soon
    are not counted as negative samples erroneously. However, as a consequence, patients who die within 30
    days of discharge are _not included in this population_. This is, however, appropriate, because the right
    way to address these competing risks is to model each of them separately in an appropriately conditional
    manner. This task, then, should be interpreted as the prediction of readmission conditional on the patient
    both surviving and staying within the health system for more than 30 days after the hospital discharge.
    Prediction of the patient's likelihood of mortality within 30 days of discharge is a separate task. Note
    that this task is only suitable for datasets for which patients can be tracked across multiple
    hospitalizations. Note that this task is **hospital** readmission, not **ICU** readmission, which we do
    not currently explore.
