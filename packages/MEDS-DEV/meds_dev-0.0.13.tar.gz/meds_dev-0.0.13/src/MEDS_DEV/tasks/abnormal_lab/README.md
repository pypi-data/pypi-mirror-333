# Abnormal Lab

This folder contains tasks for predicting abnormal lab results. Such tasks can be useful for:

1. Identifying patients who are at risk of developing a disease by using lab results as digital biomarkers.
2. Eliminating the need to perform costly or invasive tests by using predicted lab results based on less
    expensive or risky tests as a proxy.
