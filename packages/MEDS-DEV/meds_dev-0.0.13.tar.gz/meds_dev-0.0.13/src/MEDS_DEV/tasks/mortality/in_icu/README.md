# In-ICU Mortality Prediction

This task is to predict whether a patient will die in the ICU based on data from within only a limited time
window after ICU admission. In-ICU mortality prediction can be used as a proxy signal for the patient's
overall level of wellness and thus effective monitoring needs. Likely due to the availability of this target,
rather than the true possible intervention surface offered by this task, it has been a widely used prediction
target in the ML for healthcare literature to date.
