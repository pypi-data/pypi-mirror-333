Installation
------------

.. note::
   cr39py is still undergoing rapid development, and therefore an official version has not been released yet. Once an official version is released,
   the package will be installable from ``pip`` like most other python packages.


You can install cr39py by cloning the repository on `GitHub <https://github.com/pheuer/cr39py>`_

After downloading/cloning the repository, navigate to the folder and run the following command

.. code-block:: console

   pip install .

Or, if you would like to make changes to the source code, create an editable installation by including the ``-e`` flag

.. code-block:: console

   pip install -e .
