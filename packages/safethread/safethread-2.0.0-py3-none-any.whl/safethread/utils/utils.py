    Wraps a given callback function in a try-except-finally block.

    This utility function allows for the execution of a callback function with error
    handling and final actions. If an exception occurs during the execution of the 
    `callback`, the `callback_fail` function is called. If no exception occurs, the
    `callback_succ` function is called. Regardless of success or failure, 
    the `callback_final` function will always be executed in the finally block.

    :param callback: The function to be executed within the try block.
    :type callback: Callable

    :param callback_succ: The function to be executed if mo exception is raised.
    :type callback_succ: Callable, optional (defaults to a no-op lambda)

    :param callback_fail: The function to be executed if an exception is raised.
    :type callback_fail: Callable, optional (defaults to a no-op lambda)

    :param callback_final: The function to be executed in the finally block, regardless of success or failure.
