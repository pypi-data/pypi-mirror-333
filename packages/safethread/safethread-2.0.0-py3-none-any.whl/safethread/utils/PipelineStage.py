class PipelineStage:
    """
    A pipeline stage that processes data through a callback function.
    It can run N separate threads to read and write data in parallel.

    This class allows data to be pushed to an input queue, where it is processed
    by the provided callback function, and the result is then placed in an output
    queue. This can be useful for concurrent processing of tasks in a pipeline
    fashion.

    The pipeline runs indefinitely until :meth:`stop()` is called.

    :param callback: The function (or callable) that processes input data and 
                     produces output. The callback should accept one argument 
                     and return the processed result.
    :type callback: Callable

    :raises ThreadBase.CallableException: If the provided callback is not callable.
    :raises ValueError: If `n_threads` is less than 1.
