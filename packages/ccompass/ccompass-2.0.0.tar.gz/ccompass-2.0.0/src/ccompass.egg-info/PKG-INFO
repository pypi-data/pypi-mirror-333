**C-COMPASS** (Cellular COMPartmentclASSifier) is an open-source software tool designed to predict the spatial distribution of proteins across cellular compartments. It uses a neural network-based regression model to analyze multilocalization patterns and integrate protein abundance data while considering different biological conditions. C-COMPASS is designed to be accessible to users without extensive computational expertise, featuring an intuitive graphical user interface.

The data analyzed by C-COMPASS typically derives from proteomics fractionation samples that result in compartment-specific protein profiles. Our tool can be used to analyze datasets derived from various experimental techniques.

![C-COMPASS Overview](doc/gfx/ccompass_gui_sample_data_screenshot.png)

## Key Features

- **Protein Localization Prediction**: Use a neural network to predict the spatial distribution of proteins within cellular compartments.
- **Dynamic Compartment Composition Analysis**: Model changes in compartment composition based on protein abundance data under various conditions.
- **Comparison of Biological Conditions**: Compare different biological conditions to identify and quantify relocalization of proteins and re-organization of cellular compartments.
- **Multi-Omics Support**: Combine your proteomics experiment with different omics measurements such as lipidomics to bring your project to the spacial multi-omics level.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: No coding skills required; the tool features a simple GUI for conducting analysis.

## Documentation

Further documentation is available at https://c-compass.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.

## Installation

### Single-file executables

Single-file executables that don't require a Python installation are available
on the [release page](https://github.com/ICB-DCM/C-COMPASS/releases)
for Linux, Windows, and macOS.
Download the appropriate file for your operating system and run it.

On Windows, make sure to install the Microsoft C and C++ (MSVC) runtime
libraries before ([further information](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170),
[direct download](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe)).

Unreleased versions can be downloaded from
[![Build and Package](https://github.com/ICB-DCM/C-COMPASS/actions/workflows/bundle.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/ICB-DCM/C-COMPASS/actions/workflows/bundle.yml).
(Click on the latest run, then choose the version for your operating system
from the "Artifacts" section. Requires a GitHub account.)

### Via pip

```bash
# install
pip install ccompass

# launch the GUI
ccompass
# or alternatively: `python -m ccompass`
```

Note that C-COMPASS currently requires Python>=3.10, and due to its
`tensorflow` dependency Python<=3.12.

On Ubuntu linux, installing the `python3-tk` package is required:

```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
```

To install the latest development version from GitHub, use:

```bash
pip install 'git+https://github.com/ICB-DCM/C-COMPASS.git@main#egg=ccompass'
```

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during installation, please refer to the
[troubleshooting guide](https://c-compass.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html#troubleshooting).

## Usage

See also https://c-compass.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html.

* The GUI will guide you through the process of loading and analyzing your
  proteomics dataset, including fractionation samples and Total Proteome
  samples.
* Follow the on-screen instructions to perform the analysis and configure
  settings only if required
* Standard parameters should fit for the majority of experiments.
  You don't need to change the default settings.
