Introduction
------------

C-COMPASS (Cellular COMPartmentclASSifier) is an advanced open-source
software tool designed for the quantitative analysis of fractionated
proteomics samples. Utilizing a neural network-based regression model,
C-COMPASS predicts the compartmental associations of proteins, enabling
users to analyze protein localization across different cellular
compartments with a high degree of accuracy.

One of the standout features of C-COMPASS is its ability to compare
different biological conditions, generating statistics that allow for
the detailed study of spatial reorganization of subcellular
compartments. This functionality provides valuable insights into how
proteins relocalize and how compartmental structures may shift under
varying experimental conditions.

The software is powered by a machine learning model trained on
established marker lists, ensuring reliable predictions. Additionally,
C-COMPASS is designed to be user-friendly, with a graphical user
interface (GUI) that makes it accessible to researchers without
extensive programming expertise.

With C-COMPASS, users can perform comprehensive quantitative analyses of
compartmental proteomics data, facilitating discoveries in cellular
biology and proteomics research.
