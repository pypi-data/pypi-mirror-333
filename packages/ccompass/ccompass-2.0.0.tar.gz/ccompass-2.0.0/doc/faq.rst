**What if one or more of my gradients are missing some fractions?**

A. By default, C-COMPASS analyses each replicate separately which means it is not necessary that all fractionations are complete. However, if the number of remaining fractions is decreased, the prediction accuracy is affected. Furthermore, it can happen that the missing fraction is an important feature for a distinct compartment. You can check the correlation matrix for marker proteins and their median profile to evaluate how distinguishable your profiles still are.
