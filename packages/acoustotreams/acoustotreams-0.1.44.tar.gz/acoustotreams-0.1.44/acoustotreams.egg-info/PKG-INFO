# acoustotreams

The package `acoustotreams` adopts the framework of the `treams` package for acoustic wave scattering in finite and periodic arrangements of particles, based on the T-matrix method.

## Installation

### Installation using pip

To install the package with pip, use

```sh
pip install acoustotreams
```
Preliminarily, you have to also install original `treams` as well as `numpy` and `scipy`
```sh
pip install treams
```
