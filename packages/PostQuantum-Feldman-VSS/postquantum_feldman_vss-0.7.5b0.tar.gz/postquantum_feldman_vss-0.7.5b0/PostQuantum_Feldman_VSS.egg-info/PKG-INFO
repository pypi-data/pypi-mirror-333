This library provides a Python implementation of Feldman's Verifiable Secret Sharing (VSS) scheme, designed with **post-quantum security** in mind. It builds upon Shamir's Secret Sharing, adding mathematical verification to ensure the integrity of distributed shares, and uses hash-based commitments to resist quantum attacks.

## ATTENTION:

This code was developed with the assistance of AI language models and has been supervised by a product manager (non-cryptographer and non-developer).  **The code has not undergone a formal security audit.** While every effort has been made to implement best practices for security and performance, it is **strongly recommended not to use this code in a production environment** without a thorough independent security review by qualified cryptography experts.  Use at your own risk.

## Key Features:

*   **Post-Quantum Security:** Employs hash-based commitments (using BLAKE3 or SHA3-256) and large prime fields (minimum 4096 bits) to provide resistance against quantum computers.  No reliance on discrete logarithm problems.
*   **Verifiable Secret Sharing:** Allows participants to verify the correctness of their shares, ensuring that the dealer has distributed shares of a valid secret.
*   **Fault Injection Countermeasures:** Includes redundant computation (`secure_redundant_execution`) and checksum verification to mitigate fault injection attacks.
*   **Efficient Batch Verification:** Optimized for verifying multiple shares simultaneously using `batch_verify_shares`.
*   **Serialization and Deserialization:** Provides secure serialization and deserialization of commitment data (`serialize_commitments`, `deserialize_commitments`), including checksums for integrity checks and handling of extra entropy for low-entropy secrets.
*   **Integration with Shamir's Secret Sharing:** Designed for seamless integration with a standard Shamir Secret Sharing implementation (specifically, it provides a helper function `create_vss_from_shamir`).
*   **Zero-Knowledge Proofs:** Includes methods to generate and verify zero-knowledge proofs of polynomial knowledge (`create_polynomial_proof`, `verify_polynomial_proof`) and dual-commitment proofs (for integration with Pedersen VSS: `create_dual_commitment_proof`, `verify_dual_commitments`).
*   **Byzantine Fault Tolerance:** Robust handling of malicious participants, including detection of equivocation, inconsistent shares, and adaptive quorum-based detection during share refreshing.  This includes methods like `_detect_byzantine_behavior`, `_process_echo_consistency`, and `_enhanced_collusion_detection`.
*   **Share Refreshing:** Implements an optimized version of Chen & Lindell's Protocol 5 (`refresh_shares`, `_refresh_shares_additive`) for securely refreshing shares without changing the underlying secret, with enhancements for asynchronous environments and improved Byzantine fault tolerance.
*   **Constant-Time Operations:** Utilizes constant-time comparison (`constant_time_compare`) and exponentiation (`secure_exp`) where appropriate to mitigate timing side-channel attacks. *However, see "Potential Vulnerabilities" below.*
*   **Optimized Cyclic Group Operations:** Features an enhanced `CyclicGroup` class implementation with a thread-safe LRU caching (`SafeLRUCache`) and precomputation for improved performance.
*   **Comprehensive Error Handling:** Includes custom exceptions for security (`SecurityError`, `SecurityWarning`), parameter (`ParameterError`), verification (`VerificationError`), and serialization (`SerializationError`) errors.
*   **gmpy2-based Arithmetic:** Leverages the `gmpy2` library for high-performance, arbitrary-precision arithmetic, critical for cryptographic operations.
*   **Deterministic Hashing:** Uses fixed-size integer representation for commitment generation (`_compute_hash_commitment_single`, `_compute_hash_commitment`), to be platform independent.

## Dependencies:

*   **gmpy2:** Required for efficient and secure large-number arithmetic. (`pip install gmpy2`)
*   **blake3:** (Highly Recommended) For fast and secure cryptographic hashing. (`pip install blake3`)
*   **msgpack:** For efficient and secure serialization. (`pip install msgpack`)

If `blake3` is not available, the library will fall back to SHA3-256, but `blake3` is strongly recommended for performance and security.

## Installation:

```bash
pip install feldman-vss-pq
```

The source code is also available on Github:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/davidosipov/feldman-vss-pq.git
cd feldman-vss-pq
```

## Basic Usage:

```python
from feldman_vss_pq import FeldmanVSS, get_feldman_vss, VSSConfig, CyclicGroup, create_vss_from_shamir
from shamir_secret_sharing import ShamirSecretSharing  # Assuming you have a Shamir implementation

# Example using a Shamir instance (replace with your actual Shamir implementation)
shamir = ShamirSecretSharing(5, 3)  # 5 shares, threshold of 3
secret = 1234567890
shares = shamir.split_secret(secret)

# Create a FeldmanVSS instance from the Shamir instance
vss = create_vss_from_shamir(shamir)

# Generate commitments and a zero-knowledge proof
coefficients = shamir.generate_coefficients(secret)
commitments, proof = vss.create_commitments_with_proof(coefficients)

# Verify the proof
is_valid = vss.verify_commitments_with_proof(commitments, proof)
print(f"Proof Verification: {is_valid}")  # Expected: True

# Verify a share
share_x, share_y = list(shares.items())[0]  # Example share, get first item
is_share_valid = vss.verify_share(share_x, share_y, commitments)
print(f"Share Verification: {is_share_valid}")  # Expected: True

# Serialize and deserialize commitments
serialized = vss.serialize_commitments(commitments)
deserialized_commitments, _, _, _, _ = vss.deserialize_commitments(serialized)
print(f"Commitments deserialized successfully: {commitments == deserialized_commitments}")

# Share refreshing example:
new_shares, new_commitments, verification_data = vss.refresh_shares(shares, 3, 5)
# ... further checks with verification_data ...

# --- Example without Shamir ---
# Example of direct usage (without Shamir, you need a field implementation)

#  from your_module import MersennePrimeField  # Replace with your field implementation

#  field = MersennePrimeField(4096)  # Using a 4096-bit prime
#  vss = get_feldman_vss(field)
#  coefficients = [field.random_element() for _ in range(3)]
#  commitments = vss.create_commitments(coefficients)
# ... (rest of the example similar to above)
```

## Security Considerations:

*   **Prime Size:** This library defaults to 4096-bit primes for post-quantum security. It enforces a minimum of 4096 bits. Using smaller primes is *strongly discouraged* and will trigger warnings.
*   **Safe Primes:** The library defaults to using safe primes (where `p` and `(p-1)/2` are both prime) to enhance security.  This can be configured via the `safe_prime` parameter in `VSSConfig`.
*   **Hash Algorithm:** BLAKE3 is the preferred hash algorithm for its speed and security.  The library falls back to SHA3-256 if BLAKE3 is not available.
*   **Entropy:** The library uses `secrets` for cryptographically secure random number generation.
*   **Side-Channel Attacks:** Constant-time operations are used where appropriate to mitigate timing attacks. *However, see "Potential Vulnerabilities" below.*

## Potential Vulnerabilities (Acknowledged but Not Fully Addressed):

This beta version has several known potential vulnerabilities that users should be aware of:

1.  **Timing Side-Channels:** Functions like `constant_time_compare`, `_secure_matrix_solve`, and `_find_secure_pivot` *aim* for constant-time operation but are written in pure Python. The Python interpreter, garbage collection, and underlying hardware can introduce timing variations that *might* leak information about secret values.  The *ideal* solution is to use a well-vetted cryptographic library or implement these functions in a lower-level language (e.g., C). *Use with caution in environments where precise timing measurements are possible.*

2.  **`secure_redundant_execution` Assumptions:** The `secure_redundant_execution` function assumes that the provided function is strictly deterministic and has no side effects.  If the function has any non-deterministic behavior, the redundant executions might produce different results, leading to a `SecurityError`. *Ensure functions passed to `secure_redundant_execution` are truly deterministic.*

3.  **Bias in `hash_to_group`:** The `hash_to_group` function uses rejection sampling. In rare cases, it falls back to modular reduction, introducing a *slight* statistical bias.

Future versions will aim to address these issues more comprehensively.
