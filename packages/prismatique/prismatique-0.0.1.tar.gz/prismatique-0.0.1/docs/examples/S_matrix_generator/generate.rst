Example of :math:`S`-matrix generation
======================================

Example description
-------------------

In this example, we generate the :math:`S`-matrices for the bilayer
:math:`\text{MoS}_2` sample that we defined in the
:ref:`atomic_coord_generator_example_sec` page. See the documentation for the
subpackage :mod:`prismatique.stem` for a discussion on :math:`S`-matrices.

Code
----

Below is the code that generates the aforementioned :math:`S`-matrices. You can
also find the same code in the file
``<root>/examples/S_matrix_generator/generate.py`` of the repository, where
``<root>`` is the root of the ``prismatique`` repository. To run the script from
the terminal, change into the directory containing said script, and then issue
the following command::

  python generate.py

The output files generated by this script are saved in the directory
``<root>/examples/data/S_matrix_generator_output``, where ``<root>`` is the root
of the ``prismatique`` repository. To analyze the output, use the Jupyter
notebook
``<root>/examples/output_data_analysis_notebooks/analyzing_S_matrix_generator_output.ipynb``.

If you would like to modify this script for your own work, it is recommended
that you copy the original script and save it elsewhere outside of the git
repository so that the changes made are not tracked by git.
