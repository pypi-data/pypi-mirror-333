Example of potential slice generation
=====================================

Example description
-------------------

In this example, we generate the potential slices for the bilayer
:math:`\text{MoS}_2` sample that we defined in the
:ref:`atomic_coord_generator_example_sec` page. See the documentation for the
class :class:`prismatique.discretization.Params` for a discussion on potential
slices.

Code
----

Below is the code that generates the aforementioned potential slices. You can
also find the same code in the file
``<root>/examples/potential_slice_generator/generate.py`` of the repository,
where ``<root>`` is the root of the ``prismatique`` repository. To run the
script from the terminal, change into the directory containing said script, and
then issue the following command::

  python generate.py

The output files generated by this script are saved in the directory
``<root>/examples/data/potential_slice_generator_output``, where ``<root>`` is
the root of the ``prismatique`` repository. To analyze the output, use the
Jupyter notebook
``<root>/examples/output_data_analysis_notebooks/analyzing_potential_slice_generator_output.ipynb``.

If you would like to modify this script for your own work, it is recommended
that you copy the original script and save it elsewhere outside of the git
repository so that the changes made are not tracked by git.
