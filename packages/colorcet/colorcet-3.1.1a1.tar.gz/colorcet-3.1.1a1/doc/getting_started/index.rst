Installation
------------

Colorcet supports Python 3.7 and greater on Linux, Windows, or Mac
and can be installed with conda::

    conda install colorcet

or with pip::

    pip install colorcet

Usage
-----

Once you've installed colorcet the colormaps will be available
in two formats:

1.  A Bokeh-style palette, i.e., a Python list of RGB colors as hex
    strings, like \['\#000000', ..., '\#ffffff'\]
2.  A Matplotlib LinearSegmentedColormap using normalized magnitudes,
    like LinearSegmentedColormap.from\_list("fire",\[ \[0.0,0.0,0.0\],
    ..., \[1.0,1.0,1.0\] \], 256)

Import colorcet and use the new colormaps anywhere you would use a
regular colormap.

**Matplotlib**::

    import numpy as np
    import colorcet as cc
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    xs, _ = np.meshgrid(np.linspace(0, 1, 80), np.linspace(0, 1, 10))
    plt.imshow(xs, cmap=cc.cm.colorwheel);  # use tab completion to choose

**Bokeh**::

    import numpy as np
    import colorcet as cc
    from bokeh.plotting import figure, show

    xs, _ = np.meshgrid(np.linspace(0, 1, 80), np.linspace(0, 1, 10))
    p = figure(x_range=(0, 80), y_range=(0, 10), height=100, width=400)

    p.image(image=[xs], x=0, y=0, dw=80, dh=10, palette=cc.fire)  # use tab completion to choose
    show(p)
