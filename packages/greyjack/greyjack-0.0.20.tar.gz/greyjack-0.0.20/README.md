_In optimum we trust._

GreyJack Solver is an AI constraint solver for Python (current version) built on top of Polars. 
It empowers you to solve a wide range of constraint optimization problems, including continuous, integer, and mixed-integer challenges.

# Editions

There are 2 editions of GreyJack Solver:

- [Rust version](https://github.com/CameleoGrey/greyjack-solver-rust/) Ready to use, but there is still a lot of work to "complete" solver.
- Python version (this repo, developing in progress...).

# Common info

Developing of Python version is in progress. Repo is public to bind repo name, pip package name and show, that there will be something more than only Rust version.
