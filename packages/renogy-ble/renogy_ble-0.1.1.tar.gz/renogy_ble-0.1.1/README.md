# Renogy BLE

A Python library for parsing Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) data from Renogy solar charge controllers.

## Overview

Library for parsing raw BLE Modbus data from Renogy devices with BT-1 and BT-2 Bluetooth modules.

Currently supported devices:
- Renogy Rover charge controllers

## Installation

```bash
pip install renogy-ble
```

## Usage

Basic usage example:

```python
from renogy_ble import RenogyParser

# Raw BLE data received from your Renogy device
raw_data = b"\x00\x81\x00\xFA"  # Example data

# Parse the data for a specific model
parsed_data = RenogyParser.parse(raw_data, model="rover")

# Use the parsed data
print(parsed_data)
# Example output: {'battery_voltage': 129, 'pv_power': 250}
```

## Features

- Parses raw BLE Modbus data from Renogy devices
- Extracts information about battery, solar input, load output, controller status, and energy statistics
- Returns data in a flat dictionary structure
- Returns raw values (no scaling or unit conversion)

## Data Handling

### Input Format
The library accepts raw BLE Modbus response bytes and requires you to specify the device model (e.g., `model="rover"`).

### Output Format
Returns a flat dictionary of raw values:

```python
{
    "battery_voltage": 129,
    "pv_power": 250,
    "charging_status": "mppt"  # Mapped from numeric values where applicable
}
```

## Extending for Other Models

The library is designed to be easily extensible for other Renogy models. To add support for a new model:

1. Update the `REGISTER_MAP` in `register_map.py` with the new model's register mapping
2. Create a new model-specific parser class in `parser.py` (if needed)
3. Update the `RenogyParser.parse()` method to route to your new parser
