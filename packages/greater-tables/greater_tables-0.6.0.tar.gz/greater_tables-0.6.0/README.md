# Greater Tables

Creating presentation quality tables from pandas dataframes is frustrating. It is hard to left-align text and right-align numbers using pandas `display` or `df.to_html`. The  `great_tables` package does a really nice job with pandas and polars dataframes but does not support indexes or TeX output. 

This package is provides consistent HTML and TeX table output with flexible type-based formatting, and table rules. Its main class `GT` can be subclassed to set appropriate defaults for your project.

The project is currently in **beta** status. 

## The Name

Obviously, the name is a play on the `great_tables` package. But, I have been maintaining a set of macros called [GREATools](https://www.mynl.com/old/GREAT/home.html) (generalized, reusable, extensible actuarial tools) in VBA and Python since the late 1990s, and call all my macro packages "GREAT".

## Examples

Coming soon.
