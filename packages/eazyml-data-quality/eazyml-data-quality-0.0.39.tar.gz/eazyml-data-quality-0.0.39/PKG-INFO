## Overview
`eazyml-data-quality` is a python utility designed to evaluate the quality of datasets by performing various checks such as data shape, emptiness, outlier detection, balance, and correlation. It helps users identify potential issues in their datasets and provides detailed feedback to ensure data readiness for downstream processes.
It offers APIs for data quality assessment across multiple dimensions, including:

## Features
- **Missing Value Analysis**: Detect and impute missing values.
- **Bias Detection**: Uncover and mitigate bias in datasets.
- **Data Drift and Model Drift Analysis**: Monitor changes in data distributions over time.
- **Data Shape Quality**: Validates dataset dimensions and checks if the number of rows is sufficient relative to the number of columns.
- **Data Emptiness Check**: Identifies and reports missing values in the dataset.
- **Outlier Detection**: Detects and removes outliers based on statistical analysis.
- **Data Balance Check**: Analyzes the balance of the dataset and computes a balance score.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Identify multicollinearity, relationships between features and provides alerts for highly correlated features.
- **Summary Alerts**: Consolidates key quality issues into a single summary for quick review.

With `eazyml-data-quality`, you can ensure that your training data is clean, balanced, and ready for machine learning.

## Installation
To use the Data Quality Checker, ensure you have Python installed on your system.
### User installation
The easiest way to install data quality is using pip:
```bash
pip install -U eazyml-data-quality
```
### Dependencies
This package requires:
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- numpy
- openpyxl
- eazyml-insight

## Usage
Here's an example of how you can use the APIs from this package.

#### Imports
```python
from eazyml_data_quality import ez_data_quality
```

#### Initialize and Read Data
```
# Initialize the EazyML automl library.
_ = ez_init()

# Define training data (Replace with the correct data path).
train_data_path = "path_to_your_training_data.csv"

# Define test data (Replace with the correct data path).
test_data_path = "path_to_your_test_data.csv"
```

#### Perform Data Quality
```
# Define the outcome (target variable)
outcome = "target"  # Replace with your target variable name

# Customize options to perform data quality
dqa_options = {
               "data_shape": "yes",
               "data_balance": "yes",
               "data_emptiness": "yes",
               "data_outliers": "yes",
               "remove_outliers": "yes",
               "outcome_correlation": "yes",
               "data_drift": "yes",
               "model_drift": "yes",
               "prediction_data": test_data_path,
               "data_completeness": "yes",
               "data_correctness": "yes"
              }

# Call the EazyML APIs to perform data quality
dqa_response = ez_data_quality(train_data_path, outcome, options=dqa_options)

# dqa_response is a dictionary object with following keys.
# print(dqa_response.keys())
# dict_keys(['success', 'message', 'data_shape_quality', 'data_emptiness_quality', 'data_outliers_quality', 'data_balance_quality', 'data_correlation_quality', 'data_completeness_quality', 'data_correctness_quality', 'drift_quality', 'data_bad_quality_alerts'])

# the response object contains a dictionary with the results of all data quality checks, along with the data quality alerts selected by the user.
