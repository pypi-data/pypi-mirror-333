# Univlm Model Framework

## Description
The Univlm Model Framework provides a flexible and extensible system for loading, processing, and performing inference across various AI models. It aims to simplify interaction with multiple model types and platforms, offering a unified pipeline for Vision-Language Models (VLM). This makes it easier to integrate visual and linguistic information for a range of tasks, such as image captioning, visual question answering, and more.

Our framework supports a variety of models, including those from Hugging Face (HF), VLLM, and other models not natively supported on either platform. This flexibility allows you to easily load and use models from diverse sources, whether they are available on HF, VLLM, or custom-built models that donâ€™t fit into standard frameworks.

## Prerequisites
- We strongly recommend using Conda for a virtual environment. See the [Conda Installation Guide](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/stable/user-guide/install/index.html).
- OS: Linux
