def patch_r10_config_txt():
    """
    A hardware 'feature' of the SJ201R10 prevents stopping the fan when the RPi
    is shut down. This method patches `config.txt` to keep the fan off when
    shut down using the `gpio-poweroff` kernel mod. It will also default the
    fan pin (13) to a pull_up state on boot to turn off the fan.

    Not that applying this patch means `reboot` commands will cause a kernel
    panic; it is expected that some external component will cut power to the
    RPi when the shutdown target is reached.

    Note that applying this patch changes default GPIO behavior and MAY CAUSE
    DAMAGE to other GPIO accessories.
