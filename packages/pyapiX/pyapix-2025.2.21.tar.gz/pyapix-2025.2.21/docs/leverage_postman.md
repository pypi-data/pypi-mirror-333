## Using Postman files without running Postman

Postman now forces the user to run in the cloud, including uploading sensitive
information.  And Postman was recently hacked, revealing sensitive information.
How to avoid uploading sensitive information to the Postman cloud while
continuing to get the benefit of using Postman files.  The answer is `pyMan`.
pyMan pulls `requests` from Postman files and runs them using `pyapiX` to
generate the API client.  Â¡Viola!  The benefit of Postman without the risk of
the Postman cloud.
