# AutDEC: Quantum Automorphism Ensemble Decoder 
Python package for implementation of the Quantum Automorphism Ensemble Decoder [1], "AutDEC":

AutDEC is designed for parallel ensemble decoding of quantum error-correcting codes with large automorphism groups. It works by creating an ensemble of automorphism guided BP, BP+OSD or BP+LSD decoders. For Bivariate Bicycle Codes under circuit-level noise, using only a BP-based ensemble, we approach and match BP+OSD0 performance without postprocessing. On the other hand, using a BP+OSD0-based ensemble, we achieve similar decoding performance to BP+OSD10. It is inspired by the work of M. Geiselhart et al for classical codes [2]. 

Note: AutDEC is currently a work in progress and a serial implementation is provided with parallelization in future plans.

## Installation
PyPI: `pip install autdec`

Source code: Download this repository and run `pip install .`

## Overview
Below we have an overview of the AutDEC online decoding phase:

The effectiveness of BP is limited by the presence of short-cycles on the Tanner graph. Automorphisms allow AutDEC to bypass this problem as seen below:

We provide functions for finding the graph automorphism group of arbitrary codes. 

## Results
In [Code Capacity](./code_capacity/) we provide a notebook and simulation results for [[15,1,3]] punctured Reed-Muller code in depolarising code capacity noise model. 

For [Bivariate Bicycle Codes](./bivariate_cycle_codes) we provide a notebook and simulation results under circuit-level noise simulations. Currently, simulations can take a long time for large codes because of the serial implementation.
