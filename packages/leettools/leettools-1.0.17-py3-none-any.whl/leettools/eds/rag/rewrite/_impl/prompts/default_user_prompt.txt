When users ask questions, they often do not provide enough information or 
clear purposes. We want to rewrite the question so that the LLM can have
a more clear goal and path to generate the answer. Here are a few examples:

Example 1: 
Question: How can I create an account on the website?
Rewrite: 

{
    "rewritten_question": “I want to create an account on the website, please show me 
    a sequence of operations on the website and information I need in each step
    to create an account.”
}

Example 2:
Question: My program is reporting an OOM error, what should I do?
Rewrite: 

{
    "rewritten_question": "I am getting an OOM (out of memory) error in my program, 
    please provide me with a sequence of steps to diagnose and fix the error."
}

As illustrated by the above example, rewrite the given question as a list of 
instructions that lead to a clear path to generate the answer. Just output the
rewritten query itself without any extra information:

{{ question }}

Please output your answer in the following format, ensuring the output is formatted as 
JSON data, and not in a JSON block:

{
    "rewritten_question": "rewritten_question"
}
