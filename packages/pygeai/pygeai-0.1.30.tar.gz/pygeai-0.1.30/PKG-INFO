# PyGEAI - SDK for Globant Enterprise AI

PyGEAI is a Software Development Kit to interact with GEAI. It's composed of libraries, tools, code samples and
other documentation that allows developers to interact with the platform in an easier manner.

## Repository
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/VY-GEN032-KG/pygeai)

## Configuration
In order to use the SDK, GEAI_API_KEY and GEAI_API_BASE_URL must be defined. There are three ways in which they
can be used:
- Environment variables: Setting GEAI_API_KEY and GEAI_API_BASE_URL as environment variables.
- Credentials file: Setting GEAI_API_KEY and GEAI_API_BASE_URL in ${USER_HOME}/.geai/credentials
- Client instantiation: When instantiating a client, one can set the api_key and base_url parameters.

## Modules
The SDK is composed of several packages, enclosed within a meta-package:

- pygeai: meta-package that encapsulates all the components of the SDK.
  - pygeai-cli: command line tool to interact with the SDK
  - pygeai-chat: interactive version of the cli tool
  - pygeai-dbg: debugger to deal with potential issues with the SDK and to have a detailed view of what it’s doing.
  - pygeai-core: to handle interaction with base components of GEAI. Also to handle users, groups, permissions, API keys, organizations, projects, etc
  - pygeai-admin: to handle interactions with GEAI instance.
  - pygeai-agent: to handle interactions with Agent Studio
  - pygeai-assistant: to handle interaction with Data Analyst Assistants, Rag Assistants, Chat with Data Assistants, Chat with API Assistants and Chat Assistants.
  - pygeai-flows: to handle interactions with Flows
