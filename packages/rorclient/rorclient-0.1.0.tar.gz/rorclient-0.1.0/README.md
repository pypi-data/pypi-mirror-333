üöÄ **A Python client for interacting with the ROR API.**
RORClient provides a simple, efficient way to query the [Research Organization Registry (ROR)](https://ror.org) API using **HTTPX** and **Pydantic**.

## ‚ö° Installation
> ‚ö† **Work in Progress**: RORClient is not yet available via PyPI.
> Clone the repository and install dependencies manually:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ADernild/rorclient.git
cd rorclient
uv sync
```
---

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Synchronous Client
```python
from rorclient import RORClient

with RORClient() as client:
    # Get institution details
    org = client.get_institution("03yrm5c26")
    if org:
        print(f"Found institution: {org.name}")

    # Fetch multiple institutions
    multiple_orgs = client.get_multiple_institutions(["03yrm5c26", "029z82x56"])
    print(f"Fetched {len(multiple_orgs)} institutions")

```

### Asynchronous Client
```python
import asyncio
from rorclient import AsyncRORClient

async def main():
    async with AsyncRORClient() as client:
        # Get institution details
        org = await client.get_institution("03yrm5c26")
        if org:
            print(f"Found institution: {org.name}")

        # Fetch multiple institutions
        multiple_orgs = await client.get_multiple_institutions(["03yrm5c26", "029z82x56"])
        print(f"Fetched {len(multiple_orgs)} institutions")

asyncio.run(main())

```

---

## üèõ Models
RORClient uses **Pydantic** models to structure API responses. The main model is `Institution`, which represents an organization in ROR.

Example usage:

```python
from rorclient import RORClient

client = RORClient()
org = client.get_institution("03yrm5c26")

if org:
    print(org.name)  # Stanford University
    print(org.external_ids)  # External identifiers like GRID, ISNI
    print(org.location.country)  # Country of the institution
```

For a full list of available fields, see the [institution.py](rorclient/models/institution.py) file.
You can also have a look at the [ROR API documentation](https://ror.readme.io/v2/docs/data-structure)
