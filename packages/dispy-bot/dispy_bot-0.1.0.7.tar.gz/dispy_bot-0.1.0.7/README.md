**Dispy** is a Python library that simplifies Discord bot development by handling all the complexities of asynchronous programming and API interactions. Unlike discord.py and discord.js, Dispy allows users to write straightforward Python code without worrying about intents, event loops, or async functions. The library runs everything asynchronously in the background, ensuring high performance without requiring the developer to manage any of it.

Dispy lets bot developers focus on their ideas and the structure of their bots instead of getting lost in the complexities of learning a library. It simplifies the development process, making it easier to bring creative concepts to life without the usual hassle.
