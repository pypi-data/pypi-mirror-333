# PYGDATAX
Python libray for Small Angle Neutron (SANS) and X-ray (SAXS) scattering data treatment and visualization.
This package can be used for the following instruments : 
 - Xeuss 2.0 SAXS instrument
 - SANS_LLB instrument installed at the Paul Scherrer Institut (PSI)
 - Xeuss 2.0 in reflectivity mode
## Installation
To install pygdatax, run:
```
pip install pygdatax
```
Depending on your OS and python distribution, you may need to install PyQt5 and Ipython
```
pip install pyqt5 Ipython
```
## Upgrade Version
pygdatax package is up to now often upgraded. In order to get the last version type the following command in your
 terminal or acaconda prompt
```
pip install --upgrade pygdatax
```
## Launch Graphical User Interface for Xeuss data treatment and visualization
To launch the GUI, run in you terminal (or conda prompt):
````
pygdatax_gui
````
This GUI can also be used to visualize nexus files from SANS_LLB.

## Run Graphical User Interface for scan log file visualization
From version 0.1.8, a new application  is available allowing to preview and fit the scan logfile of the Xeuss spectrometer

To launch it , run in your terminal the command:
````
pygdatax_log
````
![alt text](pygdatax_log_screenshot.png)

The two curves plotted per scans corresponds to the **roi0** (integration over the instrument's roi) signal and **ct0** signal (full detector sum)

To fit one curve, you can use the fit widget present within the toolbar. The fit will be performed on the current 
plot window which means that one can fit a speific part of the curve by zooming on it.

## Run Gaphical User Interface for X-Ray reflectivity treatment and visualzation
from version 2.0.0, a new application allows to treat and  vizualize X ray reflectiviy measurements performed on the Xeuss 2.0
apparatus. The command to run it is:
````
pygdatax_rx
````
