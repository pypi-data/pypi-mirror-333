## Installation

You can install the **DjangoPrime**, package using either `pip` or `pipenv`:

```bash
pip install djangoprime
```

## Quickstart

### 1. Initialize a New Django Project
Install DjangoPrime using pip or pipenv as shown above.


### 2. Add DjangoPrime to INSTALLED_APPS
Once installed, add djangoprime to the INSTALLED_APPS list in your settings.py file:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # other apps
    'djangoprime',
]
```

### 3. Add Middleware to MIDDLEWARE
Next, configure the middleware by adding it to the MIDDLEWARE setting in your settings.py file:

```python
MIDDLEWARE = [
    # other middleware
    'djangoprime.middleware.APIResponseMiddleware',
]
```

### 4. Configure Custom Exception Handler
To handle exceptions with the DjangoPrime custom handler, configure the EXCEPTION_HANDLER in your settings.py:

```python
REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'EXCEPTION_HANDLER': 'djangoprime.exceptions.handler.exception_handler',
}
```
This will set up a custom exception handler for better error management and reporting in your REST framework views.
