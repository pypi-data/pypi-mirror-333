    "This API demonstrates a credit-based system with automated payment handling, perfect for AI agents and automated systems. It provides real-time financial market data, allowing you to query stock ticker information programmatically. Each API call costs 1 credit. New accounts start with 1 free credit. Learn more about the L402 protocol here.\n",

    "\n",
    "- `/signup` - Create account credentials and receive API key\n",
    "- `/info` - Check account status and remaining credits\n",
    "- `/ticker/{ticker_symbol}` - Get financial data for specific tickers\n",

    "\n",
    "Our goal is to design a minimal python client to interact with the payment system. This client will be used by LLMs to pay for any paywalled services. As such, when making design considerations we should focus on lowering the friction as much as possible to agent-like systems. At the same time, there is going to be a lot of overseeing done by humans, so making it easy to visualize the offers and what is happening is fundamental. \n",
    "\n",
    "The L402 protocol relies on the `402 Payment Required` status. The 402 error is returned whenever an endpoint is paywalled and the requester has no access. This creates an maybe odd dynamic where hitting the endpoint sometimes will return directly the information (as we will see in examples below) and sometimes the 402 errors with a list of payments options."

The stock.l402.org API is a specific example which has some user management which is unrelated to the L402 protocol and payments in general. We want to focus on handling the 402 Payment Required responses and payment flow in a way that's friendly both to AI agents and human oversight.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few key considerations I'd suggest keeping in mind:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For AI agent usage, we should make the payment flow as deterministic as possible - the client should handle the 402->payment->retry cycle transparently when possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. For human oversight, I'd recommend:\n",
    "   - Clear logging of payment attempts and successes\n",
    "   - Easy visualization of payment options when choices need to be made\n",
    "\n",
    "3. For the interface design, I'd suggest:\n",
    "   - A simple high-level API that handles all the complexity internally (e.g. `get_ticker(\"AAPL\")`)\n",
    "   - But also expose lower-level methods for when more control is needed\n",
    "   - Use Python's type hints to make the interface clear\n",
    "   - Consider making it async-friendly since payment flows often involve waiting\n",
