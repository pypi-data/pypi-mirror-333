## Install

Install from PyPI running
```shell
pip install clldutils
```

## Overview

Originally, `clldutils` started out as a library for functionality often used in [clld](https://github.com/clld/clld) 
web apps. Over time, it turned into a toolbox for various data curation tasks, with a focus on cross-linguistic
data (as reflected by modules such as `clldutils.iso_639_3` or `clldutils.sfm`).

Design goals are
- wide applicability of the included functionality
- small number of dependencies, thus wide installability
