you additional rights despite this limitation, you may use the Supplemental Software only as expressly permitted in these 
License Terms; provided, in the event of any conflict between these License Terms and the Open-Source License(s) where 
such conflict would cause Intapp to violate a restriction or condition of the Open-Source License(s), the Open-Source 
License(s) shall prevail solely with respect to the specific software subject to such Open-Source License(s) and you must 
agree to, and use such software in conformance with, such licenses.
