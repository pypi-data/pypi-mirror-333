1. enter the directory of the current file
2. build the NodeJS frontend
```bash
npm init # If you are building it from the source code for the first time
npm install # If you are building it from the source code for the first time
npm run build
```
3. [optional] Install kishu core from source code
```bash
source ../.env/bin/activate # activate the virtual environment
