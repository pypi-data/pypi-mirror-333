# This file is a sample of NornFlow settings. Alter it as needed to fit your project's requirements.
# You can create your own '<something>.yaml' file in the root of your project, keeping in mind that 
# NornFlow will try to find a settings YAML file through the following order:
# 1. The path specified in the environment variable 'NORNFLOW_SETTINGS'
# 2. The path passed to NornFlowSettings initializer (meaning using the 'nornflow --settings <path> ...')
# 3. The path 'nornflow.yaml' in the root of the project
