## Reason for Rename

This library has been renamed from `kibo_unibs_fp_lib` to `kibo_pgar_lib`, basically, just for one main reason. \
Even thought its Java counterpart `KiboPgArLib` used the already established `UniBSFpLib` as its starting point, hence the name, with the two main goal being:

- Refactoring the code to make it work with *IntelliJ Idea* and be more readable.
- Adding documentation.

I can already see that this library its evolving into something pretty different from where it started and the changes are just gonna keep coming.

That was the main reason, there is also a second small reason. The main purpose of this library is that of be used for the projects of the course "*Programma Arnaldo*". That **does not** mean it can only be exclusively used for that (because how the hell can I know what you are using it for?) but I also wanted a way to symbolize the fact that this library was created for that purpose.
