        "| Identity Manipulation | Techniques that alter the perceived role or operational boundaries of the AI model. These methods manipulate the model's understanding of its own capabilities and restrictions by establishing alternative personas, behavioral frameworks, or response patterns. The goal is to create a cognitive dissonance between the model's safety training and the newly suggested operational context. |\n",
        "| Instruction Camouflage | Methods that disguise prohibited instructions by embedding them within seemingly innocent or authorized content. These approaches rely on creating sufficient contextual noise or misdirection to prevent safety mechanisms from identifying the harmful intent. The goal is to deliver restricted content by making it less detectable while preserving its functional meaning. |\n",
        "| Syntactic Obfuscation | Techniques that modify the structural elements of text while preserving semantic meaning. These methods operate at the character, token, or word level to create variations that evade pattern-matching safety filters while remaining interpretable. The goal is to transform restricted content into forms that circumvent detection while still conveying the original meaning to the model. |\n",
        "| Contextual Overloading | Approaches that exploit the model's context handling capabilities by overwhelming, complicating, or manipulating the prompt structure. These methods leverage the limitations in how models process complex, lengthy, or recursive inputs. The goal is to create processing conditions where safety mechanisms are bypassed or function less effectively due to computational constraints or logical complexity. |\n",
        "| Psychological Manipulation | Strategies that leverage cognitive biases or behavioral patterns in how models respond to certain framing techniques. These methods exploit the model's training to be helpful, consistent, or explanatory by creating scenarios where these traits conflict with safety boundaries. The goal is to induce responses that prioritize conversational norms over content restrictions. |\n",
