The majority position among linguists today is that the similarities are better explained as areal features arising from prolonged cohabitation rather than natural genealogical changes that would stem from a common protolanguage. Over the years, Aymara has gradually lost speakers to both Spanish and Quechua, with many communities that were once Aymara-speaking now speaking Quechua.   \n",

              "25  Aymara is classified as an agglutinating and, to a certain extent, a polysynthetic language. It has a subject–object–verb word order and is based on a three-valued logic system. Aymara is part of a wider language family that includes Jaqaru, another language spoken in Central Peru.\\n\\nGeographically, Aymara is primarily spoken by the Aymara people of the Bolivian Andes. There are roughly two million speakers in Bolivia, half a million in Peru, and a few thousand in northern Chile, where it is recognized as a minority language. Historically, Aymara was the dominant language over a much larger area in highland Peru, south of Cusco, but has gradually lost speakers to Spanish and Quechua over time. Additionally, Aymara placenames extend into central Peru, indicating its historical spread.   \n",

The first official alphabet to be adopted for Aymara was the Scientific Alphabet, approved in 1954. Prior to that, the language was referred to with different alphabets influenced by Spanish.   \n",
