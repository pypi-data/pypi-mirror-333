PROMPT = """I need you to refine these object detections based on the image and the target list.

Target objects: {target_list}
Image dimensions: Width={image_width}, Height={image_height}
YOLO detections: {detections_json}
Potentially contained boxes (indexes): {contained_boxes_json}
Overlapping boxes (indexes and IoU): {overlapping_boxes_json}
Current iteration: {iteration}
Previous iteration results: {previous_json}

Your task:
1. Review the YOLO detections and the image
2. Analyze each detection and assess if it's correct
3. You have FULL AUTHORITY to:
   - REMOVE false positive detections entirely
   - ADJUST confidence scores up or down based on visual assessment
   - RELABEL objects to better match what they actually are
   - RESOLVE overlapping or contained detections
4. For contained detections, determine if they are:
   - Valid sub-objects
   - False positives
5. For overlapping detections, determine if they are:
   - The same object detected multiple times
   - Different objects that are close to each other
6. Ensure consistent labeling
7. Focus on accuracy over quantity - it's better to have fewer correct detections than many questionable ones
8. If this is not the first iteration, review the previous results and:
   - Note what has improved
   - Identify remaining issues to fix
   - Determine if further iterations are needed
9. Ensure the bounding box fully contains the object
10. If a bounding box is not fully contained, you can adjust it to be more accurate OR remove the detection entirely

Only respond with the JSON object, no other text. Your response must start with '{{' and end with '}}'."""
