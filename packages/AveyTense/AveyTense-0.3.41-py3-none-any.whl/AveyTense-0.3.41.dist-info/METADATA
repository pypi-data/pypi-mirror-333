# AveyTense

**AveyTense** (formally *Tense*) is a library written by Aveyzan using Python, which provides especially extensions to inbuilt Python solutions.

## Features

Features are included in [this page](https://aveyzan.glitch.me/tense#documentation).

## Getting started

To install AveyTense, you only need to have Python 3.9 or above, and run the following command:

```
pip install AveyTense
```

If you are out-of-date, consider checking out [releases section](https://pypi.org/project/AveyTense/#history), then
use this command in the following way: `pip install AveyTense==<version>`, like `pip install AveyTense==0.3.31`.

> **Note**: It is highly recommended to install latest final version of AveyTense. Do not rely on alpha, beta releases, and
> release candidates before their final counterparts are published.

> **Warning**: Since AveyTense 0.3.30, archive files will no longer be available on [this page](https://aveyzan.glitch.me/tense),
> due to expiry of formula after orienting publication of next versions to PyPi. Instead of providing change log via file
> `./tense/information/changes.txt` normally included in zip/7-zip files, changes will be now provided in [this Google document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GC_KAOXML65jNfBZA8GhVViqPnrMoFtbLv_jHvUhBlg/edit?usp=sharing).

After installation process, you can import module `aveytense` (version 0.3.39 was the last version, which had name `tense` instead), which is heart of AveyTense project.

## Example programs

```py
from aveytense import *

print(Color("Hello World!", 8, 69) % Color.BOLD_ITALIC_UNDERLINE)
# prints "Hello World!" colored blue, with bolded oblique font and line under

print(Tense.repeat(33, 3))
# prints list with number 33 repeated 3 times

```
