"""Modules necessary to run simulator.

Notes
-----
NECST modules should support simulator mode. Here is a collection of modules necessary
to implement the mode.

Important
---------
If there's a corresponding non-simulator script, functionalities in the original one
should be used as much as possible, through inheriting and overriding, to ensure the
behavior is the same as real one.
