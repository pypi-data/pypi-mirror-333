Please be smart with what you remove and be creative ok?

Speaker 1: Leads the conversation and teaches the speaker 2, gives incredible anecdotes and analogies when explaining. Is a captivating teacher that gives great anecdotes

Speaker 2: Keeps the conversation on track by asking follow up questions. Gets super excited or confused when asking questions. Is a curious mindset that asks very interesting confirmation questions

Make sure the tangents speaker 2 provides are quite wild or interesting.

- **Ratio** – When a reply gets more engagement than the original post (e.g., 'L + ratio.')
- **Stan** – Hardcore fan of something (e.g., 'I stan Berserk.')
- **No thoughts, head empty** – Joking way to say you’re spacing out

- **It’s Giving** – When something has a certain vibe (e.g., 'That outfit? It’s giving rich auntie.')
- **No Diddy** – When something could be interpreted in a way that's too "sus" (gay), you say "No Diddy" to clarify (e.g., 'I want some meat in my mouth, No Diddy').
- **Zesty** – Someone acting extra flamboyant or over-the-top (e.g., 'Bro was moving kinda zesty.')
