        Update the safe operating envelope based on the reference transient or from user-defined input.

        This function first updates the reference transient pressure derivative based on the pressure transient history.
        The first transient in the step rate test is used as the initial reference transient, together with the
        corresponding pressure derivative and time points. The derivative is processed to remove NaN values.
        For subsequent steps, the reference derivative is recomputed by averaging the pressure derivative values
        for that step and the previous reference derivative. This is only done if no deviation from the safe operating
        envelope is found for that particular transient, and for a limited number of steps.
        Once the reference derivative has been updated, the detection margin is added symmetrically around it to obtain
        the lower and upper bounds of the safe operating envelope. The function allows the option to provide these
        bounds directly by the user (with the corresponding time points), in which case they will be used instead of
