class RateController:
    """
    Create RateController class for injection rate control.

    The class provides methods for controlling the injection rate in a step rate test.

    Attributes
    --------
    step_dq: float
        The rate step in m^3/s. Sign convention is negative for injection.
    step_dt: float
        The step duration in seconds, assumed constant for all steps, but the control logic can also handle variable step duration.
    n_steps: int
        The number of steps in step rate test.
    min_dq: float
        The minimum rate step (in absolute value) in m^3/s.
    max_dq: float
        The maximum rate step (in absolute value) in m^3/s.
    q_inj: float
        The injection rate at the current step in m^3/s. Sign convention is negative for injection.
    q_inj_previous_step: float
        The injection rate at the previous step in m^3/s. Sign convention is negative for injection.
    step_start_time: float
        The current step start time in seconds, relative to the simulation start time.
    step_end_time: float
        The current step end time in seconds, relative to the simulation start time.
    step_index: int
        The current step index.
    return_to_previous_injection_step: boolean
        If this flag is True, the controller will use the injection rate from the previous step.

    Methods
    --------
    reduce_rate_step():
        Reduce the rate step by a multiplication factor.
    increase_rate_step():
        Increase the rate step by a multiplication factor.
    react_to_deviation():
        React to a deviation from the safe operating envelope.
    update_parameters_for_next_step():
        Update controller parameters for the next injection rate step.

        Reduce the rate step by a multiplication factor.

        This function applies a multiplication factor between 0 and 1 to reduce the current rate step.

        Parameters
        --------

        Parameters

            2. the step start time is set to the time when the deviation is detected;
            3. the step end time is set to the new start time plus the step duration.

        Parameters
        --------
        t_deviation: float
            The time at which the deviation is detected, in seconds (relative to the simulation start time).
