# TeraChem Protobuf Client for Trio

A lightweight Python-native async implementation.

It follows mostly the TeraChem CommBox client API, so it should work out-of-the-box.
See the snippets in [`example/`](example) to get a taste of it!

## Installation

In a Python virtual environment (Python >= 3.10),

```bash
pip install tcpb-trio
```
