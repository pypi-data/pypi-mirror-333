# spice-to-sch

A CLI to convert SkyWater SKY130 spice files into xschem .sch files. Designed for [sifferman/sky130_schematics](https://github.com/sifferman/sky130_schematics).

## Installation

Download the latest .whl file from [releases](https://github.com/eliahreeves/spice-to-sch/releases/latest).

### For uv users

```bash
uv tool install spice_to_sch-0.1.2-py3-none-any.whl
```

### For pip users (untested)

```bash
pip install spice_to_sch-0.1.2-py3-none-any.whl
```

## Usage

> [!CAUTION]
> The output file will be overwritten without warning.

Specify and input .spice and and output .sch file.

```bash
spice-to-sch -i file.spice -o file.sch
```

Input and output will default to stdin and stdout making this equivalent to the above command:

```bash
cat file.spice | spice-to-sch > file.sch
```

## Limitations

- Currently this program will assume all components are transistors. Using this on a .spice file with other components will not work.
- Although schematics will pass a Layout Versus Schematic (LVS) check, all components will be in a simple grid and must be manually rearranged.

## Running from source with uv

git clone git@github.com:eliahreeves/spice-to-sch.git
