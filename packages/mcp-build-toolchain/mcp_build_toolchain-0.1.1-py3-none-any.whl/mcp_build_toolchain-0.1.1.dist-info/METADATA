# mcp-build-toolchain MCP Server

Advanced build toolchain with compilation error analysis and filtering capabilities

The objective of the MCP is minimize use of tokens to allow LLM model to process the warning and errors of compilation process and fix.
So some build log result could result so big to be sent to model. 

Using Clinerules can send information to specific project and what to do with results.
Also can use a second file where warning and/or errors can be added to avoid the model to try to fix them.

## Key Components

### MCP Tool: get-compilation-errors

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[get-compilation-errors] --> B[Analyzes build output]
    B --> C[Extracts errors/warnings]
    C --> D[Filters using .clinerules]
    D --> E[Provides structured results]
```

Key features:
- Processes raw compilation logs into structured data
- Integrates with .clinerules for targeted filtering
- Prioritizes critical errors first
- Generates actionable remediation steps

### .clinerules Configuration

Create `.clinerules` in project root to control error handling:

Describe how to compile and how to react to the different errors/warnings:

```markdown

# Files
Command to build/compile: `.\build.cmd`
outfile to read to get warnings and errors result from the compilation: `output_log_file.log`, use absolute path.

# Tasks
- If user request to check or solve compilation errors or warnings follow to following procedure
- In case user request to compile or build use the command: build.cmd *Replace by user command*
- Use mcp server tool "mcp-build-toolchain" function "get-compilation-errors" to get the list of warnings and errors.
- In case the user tells file names, description or regular expression to filter the errors, create the regular expression and use the parameter 'regexp'
- After getting the errors and warnings try to fix them and compile again. Repeat the operation 5 times until no errores are reported.
- Check `docs/avoidable_errors.md` and do nothing with errors or warning reported in this file.
- Filter by default the errors and warnings: "*text to filter errors*" or "*text to filter warnings*"
    - This filter is applied in any position of the line and is case insensitive.
- Don't modify anything furthermore than the needed to fix the errors or warnings.
- If there is a fix that can have different solutions, ask the user for the solution to apply.
```

### Error Documentation

Maintain `docs/avoidable_errors.md` with common issues:

```markdown
## Avoidable Warnings
- W0611: Unused import → Remove unused packages
- E302: Expected 2 blank lines → Follow PEP8 spacing

## Ignorable Errors  
- E266: Too many leading '#' → Style preference
- W504: Line break after binary operator → Project-specific
```
