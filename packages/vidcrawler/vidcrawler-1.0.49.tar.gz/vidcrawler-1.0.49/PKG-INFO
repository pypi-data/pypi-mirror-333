# vidcrawler

Crawls major videos sites like YouTube/Rumble/Bitchute/Brighteon for video content and outputs a json feed of all the videos that were found.

Note that bitchute doesn't like the github runner's IP and will fail with a 403 forbidden.

## API

#### Command line

`vidcrawler --input_crawl_json "fetch_list.json" --output_json "out_list.json"`

#### Python

```python
import json
from vidcrawler import crawl_video_sites
crawl_list = [
    [
        "Computing Forever",  # Can be whatever you want.
        "bitchute",  # Must be "youtube", "rumble", "bitchute" (and others).
        "hybm74uihjkf"  # The channel id on the service.
    ]
]
output = crawl_video_sites(crawl_list)
print(json.dumps(output))
```

"source" and "channel_id" are used to generate the video-platform-specific urls to fetch data. The "channel name"
is echo'd back in the generated json feeds, but doesn't not affect the fetching process in any way.

## Testing

Install vidcrawler and then the command `vidcralwer_test` will become available.

```bash
> pip install vidcrawler
> vidcrawler_test
```

# youtube-pull-channel

This new command will a channel and all of it's files as mp3s. Great for transcribing and putting into an LLM.


#### Example input `fetch_list.json`

```json
[
    [
        "Health Ranger Report",
        "brighteon",
        "hrreport"
    ],
    [
        "Sydney Watson",
        "youtube",
        "UCSFy-1JrpZf0tFlRZfo-Rvw"
    ],
    [
        "Computing Forever",
        "bitchute",
        "hybm74uihjkf"
    ],
    [
        "ThePeteSantilliShow",
        "rumble",
        "ThePeteSantilliShow"
    ],
    [
        "Macroaggressions",
        "odysee",
        "Macroaggressions"
    ]
]
```

#### Example Output:

```json
[
  {
    "channel_name": "ThePeteSantilliShow",
    "title": "The damage this caused is now being totaled up",
    "date_published": "2022-05-17T05:00:11+00:00",
