## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About

BUDA is a **cutting-edge experimental cybersecurity solution** designed to **automate the simulation of realistic user behaviors** within **decoy environments**.  

By integrating:  
‚úÖ **Strategic narratives**  
‚úÖ **Dynamic user profiles**  
‚úÖ **Automated activity simulation**  

BUDA models **credible decoys** that **mislead attackers** and **strengthen defense mechanisms**.  

It **recreates normal activity patterns** in your environment, enhancing **deception strategies** through the **generation of automated and realistic digital footprints**.

## üöÄ Features
- **Extract context from Windows EVTX Logs**  
- **Narrative Management**  
- **User Profiles Management**
- **Activity generation engine**
- **LLM Integration for Assisted Generation**
- **Narrative-Driven Deception**

## üî• How It Works

BUDA operates by simulating realistic user behaviors within a **decoy environment** to enhance cyber deception strategies. It achieves this through the orchestration of several key components working in concert.  

### üõ† Process Breakdown  

#### üìå Context Integration  
The process begins by integrating real-world environmental data into BUDA through the **Global Context**. This involves uploading **EVTX logs** to extract information such as:  
- Usernames  
- IP addresses  
- Device names  

These details influence all aspects of activity creation and command execution. The **Global Context** serves as the foundation for generating realistic simulations.  

#### üìñ Narrative Definition  
Next, you define **Narratives**, which act as the **strategic backbone** of the deception operation. A **narrative** outlines:  
- **Operational goals** (e.g., diverting attacks, enabling early detection)  
- **Simulated user profiles** participating in the deception  
- **Attacker profile expectations**  
- **Deception activities** (fake resources)  

By setting a **similarity threshold**, you can control how closely the simulated behavior mimics real user activity.  

#### üë§ User Profile Creation  
With a **narrative** in place, you configure **User Profiles**, representing **simulated identities**. These profiles mimic real users by defining attributes such as:  
- Name and role  
- Behavioral patterns (work hours, application usage)  
- WinRM server details for executing activities  

Profiles can be created manually or generated with **Language Models (LLMs)**. Each profile is linked to one or more narratives, defining its role in deception operations.  

#### üé≠ Activity Simulation  
BUDA then **simulates user actions** through **Activities**, creating a credible digital footprint. Activities are defined by:  
- **Action types** (e.g., browsing, logins, file access)  
- **Action details** (e.g., target file, URL)  
- **Assigned user profiles** performing the activity  

You can manually create custom activity sequences or use **LLM-assisted generation** to design effective **deception strategies**.  

#### ü§ñ LLM Assistance  
Throughout the process, BUDA leverages **Language Models (LLMs)** for realistic and contextually relevant data generation. You can configure the LLM provider (**OpenAI or LM Studio**) and the specific model in the BUDA settings.  

#### üöÄ Execution and Monitoring  
Once narratives, user profiles, and activities are configured, BUDA executes the **simulated actions**. The resulting activity traces aim to:  
- **Create a realistic but deceptive environment**  
- **Monitor interactions** with decoy elements  
- **Achieve early detection** of adversaries  
- **Divert attacker attention** from real assets  
- **Calibrate and validate monitoring systems**  

### üîé Summary  
BUDA **populates a believable environment** with **fake user identities** engaging in **normal-looking activities**, making it harder for attackers to distinguish between **real and decoy** systems. This approach enhances **cyber defense** by:  
‚úÖ Providing early warnings  
‚úÖ Diverting threats  
‚úÖ Refining deception tactics
