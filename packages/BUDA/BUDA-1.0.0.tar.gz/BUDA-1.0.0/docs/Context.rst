- **Upload evtx logs:**
   - Navigate to the `Context` tab in the BUDA interface.
   - Select the desired evtx file from your local system and click `Open`.
   - The uploaded evtx logs will be displayed in the `Uploaded evtx logs` section.
   - Click on the `Upload` button to import the evtx logs.
