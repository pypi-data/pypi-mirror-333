Behavioral User-driven Deceptive Activities Framework (BUDA)
============================================================

BUDA is an deception-based security framework designed to enhance **deception operations** by adding realistic traces of human to deception activities.

It enables **consistency** in the generation of deception operations by **automating** the process of **generating** and **executing** deception operations.
