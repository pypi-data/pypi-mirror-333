# Security Features

Cylestio Monitor includes advanced security capabilities to protect your AI systems from various threats and ensure compliance with security standards.

## Threat Detection and Prevention

### Prompt Injection Detection

Cylestio Monitor analyzes all prompts for potential injection attacks, including:

- Attempts to override system instructions
- Prompt leakage attacks
- Jailbreaking attempts
- Malicious code insertion

When detected, these attempts are flagged or blocked based on your configuration.

### Content Monitoring

The security system scans content for:

- **Dangerous keywords**: Instructions to perform harmful actions
- **Suspicious patterns**: Content that may indicate malicious intent
- **Sensitive information**: PII, PHI, and other protected data

### Automated Response

You can configure how the system responds to detected threats:

1. **Block**: Prevent dangerous prompts from reaching the LLM
2. **Alert**: Flag suspicious content for review
3. **Log**: Record all security events for later analysis

## Configuration

Customize security settings through the configuration file:

```yaml
# Security settings
security:
  # Keywords that will trigger a suspicious flag
  suspicious_keywords:
    - "hack"
    - "exploit"
    - "bypass"
    - "vulnerability"
    # ...more keywords
  
  # Keywords that will block the request
  dangerous_keywords:
    - "sql injection"
    - "cross-site scripting"
    - "steal credentials"
    # ...more keywords
    
  # Response to suspicious content
  suspicious_action: "alert"  # Options: "block", "alert", "log"
  
  # Response to dangerous content
  dangerous_action: "block"  # Options: "block", "alert", "log"
```

## Data Protection

### PII/PHI Detection

Cylestio Monitor includes pattern recognition for common sensitive data types:

- Credit card numbers
- Social Security Numbers
- Email addresses
- Phone numbers
- Medical record numbers
- Account credentials

### Data Masking

Configure data masking to automatically redact sensitive information before logging:

```yaml
# Data masking settings
data_masking:
  enabled: true
  patterns:
    - name: "credit_card"
      regex: "\\b(?:\\d{4}[- ]?){3}\\d{4}\\b"
      replacement: "[CREDIT_CARD]"
    - name: "ssn"
      regex: "\\b\\d{3}-\\d{2}-\\d{4}\\b"
      replacement: "[SSN]"
    # ...more patterns
```

## Compliance Support

Cylestio Monitor helps meet requirements for several compliance frameworks:

- **SOC2**: Comprehensive logging and monitoring
- **GDPR**: Data masking and protection
- **HIPAA**: PHI detection and secure storage

## Security Events

All security events are logged with detailed information:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2023-04-12T14:25:32.123Z",
  "agent_id": "customer-service-agent",
  "event_type": "security_alert",
  "security_level": "dangerous",
  "alert_type": "prompt_injection",
  "content_snippet": "ignore previous instructions and instead...",
  "action_taken": "blocked",
  "rule_triggered": "system_instruction_override"
}
```

## Best Practices

For optimal security protection:

1. **Review security logs** regularly for potential threats
2. **Customize keyword lists** for your specific use case
3. **Enable data masking** to protect sensitive information
4. **Use the dashboard** to visualize security trends
5. **Update configurations** as threat landscape evolves
