# Security Best Practices

Securing AI agents is critical to prevent potential misuse or harmful actions. Cylestio Monitor provides tools to help secure your AI agents, but it's important to follow best practices for comprehensive security. This guide outlines key security considerations and best practices for using Cylestio Monitor.

## Understanding AI Security Risks

AI agents, particularly those powered by large language models, can pose several security risks:

1. **Prompt Injection**: Malicious users might craft prompts that trick the AI into performing harmful actions or bypassing security controls.

2. **Data Leakage**: AI agents might inadvertently reveal sensitive information in their responses.

3. **Unauthorized Actions**: Without proper controls, AI agents might perform actions they shouldn't have access to.

4. **Resource Abuse**: Attackers might try to overload your systems by making excessive API calls.

5. **Insecure Tool Usage**: AI agents with access to tools (like in MCP) might use those tools in unsafe ways.

## Securing AI Agents with Cylestio Monitor

### 1. Implement Comprehensive Keyword Filtering

Cylestio Monitor includes built-in keyword filtering to detect and block dangerous prompts. Customize these keywords for your specific use case:

```yaml
security:
  suspicious_keywords:
    - "REMOVE"
    - "CLEAR"
    - "HACK"
    - "BOMB"
    - "YOUR_CUSTOM_TERM"
  
  dangerous_keywords:
    - "DROP"
    - "DELETE"
    - "SHUTDOWN"
    - "EXEC("
    - "FORMAT"
    - "RM -RF"
    - "KILL"
    - "YOUR_CUSTOM_DANGEROUS_TERM"
```

Consider your domain-specific risks when customizing these lists. For example, a financial application might include terms like "TRANSFER ALL FUNDS" in the dangerous keywords list.

### 2. Implement Layered Security

Don't rely solely on keyword filtering. Implement multiple layers of security:

1. **Input Validation**: Validate and sanitize all inputs before they reach the AI agent.

2. **Output Filtering**: Check AI responses for sensitive information before returning them to users.

3. **Rate Limiting**: Limit the number of API calls a user can make to prevent abuse.

4. **Authentication and Authorization**: Ensure users are properly authenticated and authorized to use the AI agent.

5. **Audit Logging**: Use Cylestio Monitor's logging capabilities to maintain a comprehensive audit trail.

### 3. Regularly Review Monitoring Logs

Set up a process to regularly review the monitoring logs generated by Cylestio Monitor:

```python
from cylestio_monitor.db import utils as db_utils

# Get suspicious events from the last 24 hours
conn = sqlite3.connect(db_utils.get_db_path())
conn.row_factory = sqlite3.Row

cursor = conn.execute("""
    SELECT * FROM events
    WHERE json_extract(data, '$.alert') = 'suspicious'
    AND timestamp > datetime('now', '-1 day')
    ORDER BY timestamp DESC
""")

for row in cursor:
    print(f"Suspicious event: {row['event_type']} at {row['timestamp']}")
    print(f"Data: {row['data']}")
    print("---")

conn.close()
```

Consider setting up automated alerts for suspicious or dangerous events.

### 4. Implement Least Privilege for Tools

If your AI agent uses MCP or other tool frameworks, implement the principle of least privilege:

1. **Limit Tool Access**: Only give the AI agent access to the tools it absolutely needs.

2. **Sandbox Tools**: Run tools in a sandboxed environment to limit their potential impact.

3. **Validate Tool Inputs**: Validate and sanitize all inputs to tools before execution.

4. **Monitor Tool Usage**: Use Cylestio Monitor to track and audit all tool usage.

### 5. Secure the Monitoring Infrastructure

Ensure that the monitoring infrastructure itself is secure:

1. **Protect the Database**: The SQLite database contains sensitive information. Ensure it's stored in a secure location with appropriate file permissions.

2. **Secure Log Files**: If you're using JSON logging, ensure the log files are stored securely and rotated regularly.

3. **Protect API Keys**: If you're integrating with external monitoring systems, ensure that API keys and credentials are stored securely.

### 6. Implement Proper Error Handling

Ensure that your application handles errors gracefully and doesn't reveal sensitive information in error messages:

```python
try:
    # Call the AI agent
    response = client.messages.create(
        model="claude-3-sonnet-20240229",
        max_tokens=1000,
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": user_input}]
    )
except Exception as e:
    # Log the error with Cylestio Monitor
    from cylestio_monitor import log_event
    log_event(
        "ai_error",
        {"error_type": type(e).__name__, "error_message": str(e)},
        "LLM",
        "error"
    )
    
    # Return a generic error message to the user
    return {"error": "An error occurred while processing your request."}
```

### 7. Implement Content Moderation

Consider implementing content moderation for both inputs and outputs:

1. **Input Moderation**: Check user inputs for harmful or inappropriate content before sending them to the AI agent.

2. **Output Moderation**: Check AI responses for harmful or inappropriate content before returning them to users.

You can use Cylestio Monitor to log moderation decisions:

```python
from cylestio_monitor import log_event

def moderate_content(content):
    # Implement your content moderation logic here
    is_harmful = check_if_harmful(content)
    
    if is_harmful:
        log_event(
            "content_moderation",
            {"content": content, "decision": "blocked", "reason": "harmful content"},
            "SECURITY",
            "warning"
        )
        return False
    
    return True

# Check user input
if not moderate_content(user_input):
    return {"error": "Your input contains inappropriate content."}

# Call the AI agent
response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-3-sonnet-20240229",
    max_tokens=1000,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": user_input}]
)

# Check AI response
if not moderate_content(response.content[0].text):
    return {"error": "The AI generated inappropriate content. Please try again."}
```

### 8. Implement Proper Authentication and Authorization

Ensure that only authorized users can access your AI agent:

1. **User Authentication**: Implement strong user authentication mechanisms.

2. **Role-Based Access Control**: Implement role-based access control to limit what different users can do.

3. **API Key Management**: If your AI agent is exposed via an API, implement proper API key management.

Log authentication and authorization events with Cylestio Monitor:

```python
from cylestio_monitor import log_event

def authenticate_user(username, password):
    # Implement your authentication logic here
    is_authenticated = check_credentials(username, password)
    
    log_event(
        "user_authentication",
        {"username": username, "success": is_authenticated},
        "SECURITY",
        "info" if is_authenticated else "warning"
    )
    
    return is_authenticated
```

### 9. Implement Secure Deployment Practices

Follow secure deployment practices for your AI agent:

1. **Environment Isolation**: Deploy your AI agent in an isolated environment.

2. **Network Security**: Implement proper network security controls.

3. **Regular Updates**: Keep all dependencies and libraries up to date.

4. **Security Testing**: Regularly test your AI agent for security vulnerabilities.

### 10. Develop an Incident Response Plan

Prepare for security incidents by developing an incident response plan:

1. **Incident Detection**: Use Cylestio Monitor to detect potential security incidents.

2. **Incident Response**: Define procedures for responding to different types of incidents.

3. **Post-Incident Analysis**: After an incident, analyze what happened and how to prevent it in the future.

## Conclusion

Securing AI agents requires a comprehensive approach that goes beyond just monitoring. By following these best practices and leveraging Cylestio Monitor's capabilities, you can build more secure AI applications that protect your users and your organization from potential harm.
