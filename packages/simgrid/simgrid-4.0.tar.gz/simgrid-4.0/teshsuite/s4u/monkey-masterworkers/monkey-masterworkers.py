"""
 This is a version of the masterworkers that (hopefully) survives to the chaos monkey.
 It tests synchronous send/receive as well as synchronous computations.

 It is not written to be pleasant to read, but instead to resist the aggressions of the monkey:
 - Workers keep going until after a global variable `todo` reaches 0.
 - The master is a daemon that just sends infinitely tasks
   (SimGrid simulations stop as soon as all non-daemon actors are done).
 - The platform is created programmatically to remove path issues and control the problem size.

 See the simgrid-monkey script for more information.

 Inline configuration items:
 - host-count: how many actors to start (including the master
 - task-count: initial value of the `todo` global
 - deadline: time at which the simulation is known to be failed (to detect infinite loops).
