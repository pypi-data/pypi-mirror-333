/**
 * @brief Those are the SimGrid version of the good ol' assert macro.
 *
 * You can pass them a format message and arguments, just as if it where a printf.
 *
 * If the statement evaluates to false, then a simgrid::AsertionError is thrown.
 * This is identical to the xbt_assert macro, except that an exception is thrown instead of calling abort().
 *
 * Unlike the standard assert, xbt_enforce is never disabled, even if the macro NDEBUG is defined at compile time.
 * Note however that this macro should *not* be used with a condition that has side effects, since the exception can be
 * caught and ignored.
