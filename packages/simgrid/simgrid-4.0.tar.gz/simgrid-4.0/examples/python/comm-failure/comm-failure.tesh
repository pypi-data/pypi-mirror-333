> [ 10.000000] (1:Sender@Host1) Sender has experienced a network failure exception, so it knows that something went wrong
> [ 10.000000] (1:Sender@Host1) Now it needs to figure out which of the two comms failed by looking at their state:
> [ 10.000000] (1:Sender@Host1)   Comm to mailbox2 has state: FAILED
> [ 10.000000] (1:Sender@Host1)   Comm to mailbox3 has state: STARTED
> [ 10.000000] (1:Sender@Host1) Waiting on a FAILED comm raises an exception: 'Cannot wait for a failed communication'
> [ 10.000000] (1:Sender@Host1) Wait for remaining comm, just to be nice
> [ 17.319588] (3:Receiver-2@Host3) Receiver has received successfully (mailbox3)!
