> [  0.000000] (0:maestro@) Configuration change: Set 'host/model' to 'ptask_L07'
> [  0.000000] (0:maestro@) Switching to the L07 model to handle parallel tasks.
> [  0.000000] (0:maestro@) First test: sequential Exec activity
> [  0.000000] (0:maestro@) Schedule Activity 'Poor task' on 'Faulty Host'
> [  0.000000] (0:maestro@) 'Poor task' is assigned to a resource and all dependencies are solved. Let's start
> [  0.000000] (0:maestro@) Run the simulation

> [ 10.000000] (0:maestro@) let's unschedule Activity 'Poor task' and reschedule it on the 'Safe Host'
> [ 10.000000] (0:maestro@) 'Poor task' is assigned to a resource and all dependencies are solved. Let's start
> [ 10.000000] (0:maestro@) Run the simulation again
> [ 50.000000] (0:maestro@) Activity 'Poor task' is complete (start time: 10.000000, finish time: 50.000000)
> [ 50.000000] (0:maestro@) Remove a dependency from 'Poor task' on 'Child'

> [ 90.000000] (0:maestro@) Schedule Activity 'Poor parallel task' on 'Safe Host' and 'Faulty Host'

> [100.000000] (0:maestro@) let's unschedule Activity 'Poor parallel task' and reschedule it only on the 'Safe Host'
