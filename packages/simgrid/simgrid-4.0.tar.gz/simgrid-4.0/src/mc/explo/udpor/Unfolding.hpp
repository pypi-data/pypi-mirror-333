   * @brief Informs the unfolding of a (potentially) new event
   *
   * The unfolding of a concurrent program is a well-defined
   * structure. Given the labeled transition system (LTS) of
   * a program, the unfolding of that program can be determined
   * algorithmically. However, UDPOR does not a priori know the structure of the
   * unfolding as it performs its exploration. Thus, events in the
   * unfolding are "discovered" as they are encountered, specifically
   * when computing the extension sets of the configurations that
   * UDPOR decides to search.
   *
   * This lends itself to the following problem: the extension sets
   * of two different configurations may overlap one another. That
   * is, for two configurations C and C' explored by UDPOR where C != C',
   *
   * ex(C) - ex(C') != empty
   *
   * Hence, when extending both `C` and `C'`, any events contained in
   * the intersection of ex(C) and ex(C') will be attempted to be added
   * twice. The unfolding will notice that these events have already
   * been added and simply return the event already added to the unfolding
   *
   * @tparam ...Args arguments passed to the `UnfoldingEvent` constructor
   * @return the handle to either the newly created event OR
   * to an equivalent event that was already noted by the unfolding
   * at some point in the past
