 * @beginrst
 *
 * Despite the simplicity of BMF fairness definition, it's quite hard to
 * find a BMF allocation in the general case.
 *
 * This solver implements one possible algorithm to find a BMF, as proposed
 * at: https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01552739.
 *
 * The idea of this algorithm is that each player/flow "selects" a resource to
 * saturate. Then, we calculate the rate each flow would have with this allocation.
 * If the allocation is a valid BMF and no one needs to move, it's over. Otherwise,
 * each player selects a new resource to saturate based on the minimim rate possible
 * between all resources.
 *
 * The steps:
 * 1) Given an initial allocation B_i
 * 2) Build a matrix A'_ji and C'_ji which assures that the player receives the most
 * share at selected resources
 * 3) Solve: A'_ji * rho_i = C'_j
 * 4) Calculate the minimum fair rate for each resource j: f_j. The f_j represents
 * the maximum each flow can receive at the resource j.
 * 5) Builds a new vector B'_i = arg min(f_j/A_ji).
 * 6) Stop if B == B' (nobody needs to move), go to step 2 otherwise
 *
 * Despite the overall good performance of this algorithm, which converges in a few
 * iterations, we don't have any assurance about its convergence. In the worst case,
 * it may be needed to test all possible combination of allocations (which is exponential).

/**
 * @beginrst
 *
 * A BMF (bottleneck max fairness) solver to resolve inequation systems.
 *
 * Usually, SimGrid relies on a *max-min fairness* solver to share the resources.
 * Max-min is great when sharing homogenous resources, however it cannot be used with heterogeneous resources.
 *
 * BMF is a natural alternative to max-min, providing a fair-sharing of heterogeneous resources (CPU, network, disk).
 * It is specially relevant for the implementation of parallel tasks whose sharing involves different
 * kinds of resources.
 *
 * BMF assures that every flow receives the maximum share possible in at least 1 bottleneck (fully used) resource.
 *
 * The BMF is characterized by:
 * - A_ji: a matrix of requirement for flows/player. For each resource j, and flow i, A_ji represents the utilization
 * of resource j for 1 unit of the flow i.
 * - rho_i: the rate allocated for flow i (same among all resources)
 * - C_j: the capacity of each resource (can be bytes/s, flops/s, etc)
 *
 * Therefore, these conditions need to satisfied to an allocation be considered a BMF:
 * 1) All constraints are respected (flows cannot use more than the resource has available)
 *   - for all resource j and player i: A_ji * rho_i <= C_j
 * 2) At least 1 resource is fully used (bottleneck).
 *   - for some resource j: A_ji * rho_i = C_j
 * 3) Each flow (player) receives the maximum share in at least 1 bottleneck.
 *   - for all player i: exist a resource j: A_ji * rho_i >= A_jk * rho_k for all other player k
 *
 * Despite the prove of existence of a BMF allocation in the general case, it may not
 * be unique, which leads to possible different rate for the applications.
 *
 * More details about BMF can be found at: https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01243985/document
