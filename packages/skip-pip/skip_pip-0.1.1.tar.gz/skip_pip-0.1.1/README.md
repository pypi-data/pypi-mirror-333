# Skip-Pip

Skip-Pip is a command-line tool that acts like pip but with enhanced resilience during package installation. When installing from a requirements file, it skips packages that fail to install while continuing with the rest.

## Features

- **Resilient Installation:** Installs each package individually from requirements files.
- **Error Logging:** Prints error details for packages that fail to install.
- **Familiar Interface:** Supports standard pip commands and arguments.

## Installation

You can install Skip-Pip via pip (after publishing on PyPI):

```bash
pip install skip-pip
