# Single Cell ssGSEA

**Description**: Single Cell ssGSEA (sc_ssGSEA) is an extension of ssGSEA tailored for single-cell data analysis. It addresses the challenge of sparsity by employing a normalization method and scoring metric chosen to minimize any variability. By utilizing sc_ssGSEA, scientists can explore and interpret pathway activity and functional alterations within heterogeneous populations of cells.
