    Create a suggestor from a definition dictionary.

    Definition is either a suggestor instance, a dict that specifies the suggestor type
    and its parameters, or None.

    If definiton is a suggestor instance it is returned as is.

    If definition is a dict, it is used to create a suggestor. The dictionary must have
    a 'name' key that specifies the type of suggestor. The other keys depend on the
    suggestor type. It can be recursive if the suggestor is a strategizer, that is, a
    suggestor that delegates ask() to other suggestors.

    If definition is None, a DefaultSuggestor is created. This is useful as a
    placeholder in strategizers, and should be replaced with a real suggestor before
    use.
