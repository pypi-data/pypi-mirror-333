"""
TensorSat is a suite of SAT/SMT solvers based on hyper-optimised contraction of diagrams
for the compact-closed category of finite sets and relations.

Boxes from multiple languages (cf. :mod:`tensorsat.lang`) are allowed to coexist within
the same diagram, and hybrid contraction strategies will be supported.
