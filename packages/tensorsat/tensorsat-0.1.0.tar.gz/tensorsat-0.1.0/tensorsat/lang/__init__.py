"""
Diagrammatic languages for the compact-closed category of sets and relations.
Every language corresponds to a choice of parametrisation for a class of relations:
specified by defining types and/or boxes:

- Every (concrete) subclass of :class:`~tensorsat.diagrams.Type` parametrises a
  class of sets (via its constructor arguments).
- Every (concrete) subclass of :class:`~tensorsat.diagrams.Box` parametrises a
  class of relations (via its constructor arguments).

The following languages are currently implemented:

- The language :mod:`~tensorsat.lang.fin_rel` of finite, explicitly enumerated sets
  and relations between them, densely represented by Boolean tensors.
