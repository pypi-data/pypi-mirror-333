CodeReview = """Perform Code Review and Generate Report

1. **Fetch the Codebase**: 
   Use the GitHub tool to fetch all files from the repository in the main branch.

2. **Run Code Quality Checks**: 
   Utilize appropriate tools (e.g., `flake8` and `pylint`) to analyze the code for quality issues. As I currently don't have the capability to run these checks directly, I will outline the steps for how to do this in the report.

3. **Generate a Summary Report**: 
   Create a markdown report that summarizes the findings from the code quality checks, including errors, warnings, and recommendations.

4. **Store the Report in the Repository**: 
   Save the report as `code_quality_report.md` in the root of the repository.
