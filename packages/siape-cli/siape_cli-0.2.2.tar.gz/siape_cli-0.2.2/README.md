## Examples

1. **Download data for residential buildings in regions**:
   ```bash
   siape-cli download -g reg -r res
   ```

2. **Filter by climatic zone and qualitative features**:
   ```bash
   siape-cli download -z -q ys
   ```

3. **Download NZEB buildings data and save as `nzeb_data.csv`**:
   ```bash
   siape-cli download -n -o nzeb_data.csv
   ```

4. **Filter using `dp412` law in provinces**:
   ```bash
   siape-cli download -d -g prov
   ```

## Rules and Restrictions

To maintain data integrity, the tool enforces the following admissible combinations:

```
reg
prov
y
s
ys
zc
dp412
reg, zc
reg, prov
reg, prov, zc
y, zc
s, zc
dp412, reg
dp412, prov
dp412, zc
dp412, y
dp412, s
dp412, ys
```

Using an invalid combination will produce an error:
```plaintext
NotAdmissibleCombination: Combination of arguments <args_set> is not admissible.
```
