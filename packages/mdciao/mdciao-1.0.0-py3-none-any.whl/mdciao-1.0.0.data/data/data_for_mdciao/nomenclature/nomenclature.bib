   abstract = {The GPCR autoproteolysis inducing (GAIN) domain is an ancient protein fold ubiquitous in adhesion G protein-coupled receptors (aGPCR). It contains a tethered agonist necessary and sufficient for receptor activation. The GAIN domain is a hotspot for pathological mutations. However, the low primary sequence conservation of GAIN domains has thus far hindered the knowledge transfer across different GAIN domains in human receptors as well as species orthologs. Here, we present a scheme for generic residue numbering of GAIN domains, based on structural alignments of over 14,000 modeled GAIN domain structures. This scheme is implemented in the GPCR database (GPCRdb) and elucidates the domain topology across different aGPCRs and their homologs in a large panel of species. We identify conservation hotspots and statistically cancer-enriched positions in human aGPCRs and show the transferability of positional and structural information between GAIN domain homologs. The GAIN-GRN scheme provides a robust strategy to allocate structural homologies at the primary and secondary levels also to GAIN domains of polycystic kidney disease 1/PKD1-like proteins, which now renders positions in both GAIN domain types comparable to one another. In summary, our work enables researchers to generate hypothesis and rationalize experiments related to GAIN domain function and pathology. Transferring information on the GAIN domain is hampered by low sequence conservation. Here, authors introduce a generic residue numbering scheme for GAIN domains to facilitate information integration as demonstrated on cancer data.},

abstract = {Recently, the concept of ligand-directed signaling-the ability of different ligands of an individual receptor to promote distinct patterns of cellular response-has gained much traction in the field of drug discovery, with the potential to sculpt biological response to favor therapeutically beneficial signaling pathways over those leading to harmful effects. However, there is limited understanding of the mechanistic basis underlying biased signaling. The glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor is a major target for treatment of type-2 diabetes and is subject to ligand-directed signaling. Here, we demonstrate the importance of polar transmembrane residues conserved within family B G protein-coupled receptors, not only for protein folding and expression, but also in controlling activation transition, ligand-biased, and pathway-biased signaling. Distinct clusters of polar residues were important for receptor activation and signal preference, globally changing the profile of receptor response to distinct peptide ligands, including endogenous ligands glucagon-like peptide-1, oxyntomodulin, and the clinically used mimetic exendin-4. {\textcopyright} PNAS 2013.},

abstract = {G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) represent one of the largest gene families in the animal genome. These receptors can be classified into several groups based on the sequence similarity of their common heptahelical domain. The family 3 (or C) GPCRs are receptors for the main neurotransmitters glutamate and $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid, for Ca2+, for sweet and amino acid taste compounds, and for some pheromone molecules, as well as for odorants in fish. Although none of these family 3 receptors have been found in plants, members have been identified in ancient organisms, such as slime molds (Dictyostelium) and sponges. Like any other GPCRs, family 3 receptors possess a transmembrane heptahelical domain responsible for G-protein activation. However, most of these identified receptors also possess a large extracellular domain that is responsible for ligand recognition, is structurally similar to bacterial periplasmic proteins involved in the transport of small molecules, and is called a Venus Flytrap module. The recent resolution of the structure of this binding domain in one of these receptors, the metabotropic glutamate 1 receptor, together with the recent demonstration that these receptors are dimers, revealed a unique mechanism of activation for these GPCRs. Such data open new possibilities in the development of drugs aimed at modulating these receptors, and raise a number of interesting questions on the activation mechanism of the other GPCRs. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science Inc.

The modulator binding site partially overlaps with the orthosteric binding sites of class A GPCRs but is more restricted than most other GPCRs. We observed a parallel 7TM dimer mediated by cholesterols, which suggests that signaling initiated by glutamate's interaction with the extracellular domain might be mediated via 7TM interactions within the full-length receptor dimer. A combination of crystallography, structure-activity relationships, mutagenesis, and full-length dimer modeling provides insights about the allosteric modulation and activation mechanism of class C GPCRs.},

The rapid pace of cloning and expression of G protein-coupled receptors offers attractive opportunities to probe the structural basis of signal transduction mechanisms at the level of these cell-surface receptors. Major insights have emerged from comparisons and classifications of the amino acid sequences of GPCRs into families defined by evolutionary developments and adapted to perform selective functions. Structural data on GPCRs, based on biochemical, immunological, and biophysical approaches have validated consensus architecture of GPCRs with an extracellular N-terminus, a cytoplasmic C-terminus, and a transmembrane portion comprised of seven-transmembrane helical domains connected by loops. Developments in the molecular modeling and computational exploration of GPCR proteins indicate a tantalizing potential to alleviate some of these difficulties. These expectations are based on the increased rate of success achieved by molecular modeling and computational simulation methods in providing structural insights relevant to the functions of biological molecules. {\textcopyright} 1995, Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {A model for the alpha-carbon positions in the seven transmembrane helices in the rhodopsin family of G-protein-coupled receptors is presented. The model incorporates structural information derived from the analysis of $\sim$ 500 sequences in this family. The location, relative to the centre of the lipid bilayer, of each of the seven helical sequence segments and their probable lengths are deduced from sequence analysis, along with the orientation, relative to the centre of the helix bundle, of each helical segment around its axis. The packing of the helices in the model is guided by the density in a three-dimensional map of frog rhodopsin determined by electron cryo-microscopy. The model suggests which of the residues that are highly conserved in this family of receptors interact with each other. Helices III, V and VI are predicted to protrude more than the others from the central lipid core towards the aqueous phase on the intracellular side of the membrane. This feature could be a property of the receptor structure in some but not all of the conformations that it adopts, since recent studies suggest that relative movement occurs between these helices on photoactivation of rhodopsin. Results from other techniques, including the creation of metal-binding sites and disulphide bridges, site-directed spin-labelling studies, the substituted-cysteine accessibility method and other site-directed mutagenesis studies, are discussed in terms of the model.},

Rhodopsin, a member of the family, is known to have transmembrane alpha-helices. The probable arrangement of the seven helices, in all receptors, was deduced from structural information extracted from a detailed analysis of the sequences. Constraints established include: (1) each helix must be positioned next to its neighbours in the sequence; (2) helices I, IV and V must be most exposed to the lipid surrounding the receptor and helix m least exposed. (l) is established from the lengths of the shortest loops. (2) is determined by considering: (i) sites of the most conserved residues; (ii) other sites where variability is restricted; (iii) sites that accommodate polar residues; (iv) sites of differences in sequence between pairs or within groups of closely related receptors. Most sites in the last category should be in unimportant positions and are most useful in determining the position and extent of lipid-facing surface in each helix. The structural constraints for the receptors are used to allocate particular helices to the peaks in the recently published projection map of rhodopsin and to propose a tentative three-dimensional arrangement of the helices in G protein-coupled receptors.},

abstract = {G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) allosterically activate heterotrimeric G proteins and trigger GDP release. Given that there are ∼800 human GPCRs and 16 different G$\alpha$ genes, this raises the question of whether a universal allosteric mechanism governs G$\alpha$ activation. Here we show that different GPCRs interact with and activate G$\alpha$ proteins through a highly conserved mechanism. Comparison of G$\alpha$ with the small G protein Ras reveals how the evolution of short segments that undergo disorder-to-order transitions can decouple regions important for allosteric activation from receptor binding specificity. This might explain how the GPCR–G$\alpha$ system diversified rapidly, while conserving the allosteric activation mechanism. There are ∼800 human GPCRs and 16 different G$\alpha$ proteins; this study revealed the molecular details of G$\alpha$ activation by GPCRs and suggests that a universal activation mechanism governs G$\alpha$ activation—the details of this mechanism can explain how the GPCR–G$\alpha$ system diversified rapidly, while conserving the allosteric activation mechanism. G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are membrane proteins that function as sensors for a wide range of extracellular signals. They act via heterotrimeric G proteins — guanine nucleotide-binding proteins that act as intracellular molecular switches — which they activate allosterically to trigger GDP release. There are hundreds of human GPCRs acting upon 16 different G$\alpha$ proteins. In this Analysis, Madan Babu and colleagues set out to establish whether there is a universal allosteric mechanism governing G$\alpha$ activation. They find that there is: different GPCRs interact with and activate G$\alpha$ proteins through a highly conserved mechanism, which might explain how the GPCR–G$\alpha$ system diversified rapidly while conserving its allosteric properties.},

abstract = {Protein kinases regulate the majority of signal transduction pathways in cells and have become important targets for the development of designer drugs. We present a systematic analysis of kinase-ligand interactions in all regions of the catalytic cleft of all 1252 human kinase-ligand cocrystal structures present in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). The kinase-ligand interaction fingerprints and structure database (KLIFS) contains a consistent alignment of 85 kinase ligand binding site residues that enables the identification of family specific interaction features and classification of ligands according to their binding modes. We illustrate how systematic mining of kinase-ligand interaction space gives new insights into how conserved and selective kinase interaction hot spots can accommodate the large diversity of chemical scaffolds in kinase ligands. These analyses lead to an improved understanding of the structural requirements of kinase binding that will be useful in ligand discovery and design studies. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Protein kinases play a crucial role in cell signaling and are important drug targets in several therapeutic areas. The KLIFS database contains detailed structural kinase-ligand interaction information derived from all ({\textgreater}2900) structures of catalytic domains of human and mouse protein kinases deposited in the Protein Data Bank in order to provide insights into the structural determinants of kinase-ligand binding and selectivity. The kinase structures have been processed in a consistent manner by systematically analyzing the structural features and molecular interaction fingerprints (IFPs) of a predefined set of 85 binding site residues with bound ligands. KLIFS has been completely rebuilt and extended ({\textgreater}65{\%} more structures) since its first release as a data set, including: novel automated annotation methods for (i) the assessment of ligand-targeted subpockets and the analysis of (ii) DFG and (iii) $\alpha$C-helix conformations; improved and automated protocols for (iv) the generation of sequence/structure alignments, (v) the curation of ligand atom and bond typing for accurate IFP analysis and (vi) weekly database updates. KLIFS is now accessible via a website (http://klifs.vucompmedchem.nl) that provides a comprehensive visual presentation of different types of chemical, biological and structural chemogenomics data, and allows the user to easily access, compare, search and download the data.},
