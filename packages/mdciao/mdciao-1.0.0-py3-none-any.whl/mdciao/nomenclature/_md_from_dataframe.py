#    Please note: The following method "from_dataframe" is a
#    modified version of the one found in the original MDTraj
#    Python Library, whose original authors and copyright
#    holders are listed below.
#
#    The modifications consist in
#    * making "from_dataframe" a standalone method (not a class method of topology)
#    * passing the chainID when adding a new chain from the dataframe
#    * needed imports
#    and are marked with the comment '#mdciao' in the file.
#    The modifications were applied on mdtraj release v1.10.0rc1
#    commit 4c9bb6e8bc7d6e86890ff0d57814c3c76f7cf792

    Parameters
    ----------
    atoms : pandas.DataFrame
        The atoms in the topology, represented as a data frame. This data
        frame should have columns "serial" (atom index), "name" (atom name),
        "element" (atom's element), "resSeq" (index of the residue)
        "resName" (name of the residue), "chainID" (index of the chain),
        and optionally "segmentID", following the same conventions
        as wwPDB 3.0 format.
    bonds : np.ndarray, shape=(n_bonds, 4) or (n_bonds, 2), dtype=float, Optional
        The bonds in the topology, represented as a n_bonds x 4 or n_bonds x 2
        size array of the indices of the atoms involved, type, and order of each
        bond, represented as floats. Type and order are optional. Specifying bonds
        here is optional. To create standard protein bonds, you can use
        `create_standard_bonds` to "fill in" the bonds on your newly created
        Topology object, although type and order of bond are not computed if
        that method is used.
