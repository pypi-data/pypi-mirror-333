r"""
These methods attempt to compute the overlaps
between Text objects in a matplotlib plot. These methods
are used by mdciao.flare exclusively, trying to
work around potential re-sizing problems by
trying to avoid re-drawings of the axis (and some shameless
fudging). Naturally, this can be error prone and hard to test.

That's why, for the moment the only tests are that
1) all code is covered by normal execution and nothing goes wrong and
b) visual inspection of the notebooks testing the flareplot schemes

In the future, I'll either understand better how matplotlib
bounding boxes work and/or use libs like shapely to detect
overlaps and stuff.

    Return, in data units, the vertices of the FancyBoxPatch of a Text object

    Will fail if the Text object wasn't instantiated with a bbox dictionary, because

    The advantage of the FancyBoxPatch is that it's rotated with the text
    and it can be used to avoid text-overlap better
