def _progress_dict2infoline(idict, first_update_after=1.5) -> str:
    r"""
    Format the progress-report string from a progress dictionary.

    The progress dictionary is a managed dictionary created by the
    method _prepare_progressbar_thread. It gets passed to the
    individual per-trajectory processes that update its fields as
    they stream through trajectories in parallel (per_traj_ctc and
    per_traj_mindist_lower_bound)

    Meanwhile, a separate thread, which also has access to the
    progress dictionary 1) updates the progress report line using
    this method and takes care of printing w/ or w/o overwriting
    lines in the standard output.

    Both the individual per-trajectory processes (per_traj_ctc and
    per_traj_mindist_lower_bound) as well as the methods that
    called them(trajs2ctcs and  trajs2lower_bounds, respectively)
    used this method to compuse the `infoline`.

    The parameters computed in this method for the `infoline`
    are:
    * n_trajs_done/n_trajs_total
    * Elapsed time
    * remaining time
    * Trajs/s
    * Frames/s

    The `infoline` looks like this:

    `Processing trajectories: 1/4 [ 25%]. Frames processed:    32001. Elapsed time:  0:00:41. Remaining time ~  0:02:04. Trajs/s:    0. Frames/s:  777`

    Please note, the Trajs/s ad Frames/s values are NOT
    instantaneous but overall computation, taking IO
    time into account (measured time is walltime, not
    process time).


    Parameters
    ----------
    idict : dict
        A managed dictionary containing  values needed to
        compile performance parameters to be printed
        in plaintext as a progressbar analog. The dictionary
        needs to have the fields:
        * 'start_time'
        * 'n_trajs_total'
        * 'n_trajs_done'
        * 'n_frames_done'

        performance values (Frames/sec

def _prepare_progressbar_thread(progressbar_dict, progressbar):
    r"""

    Prepare the objects needed for a progress report from independent processes
    to report their progress independently of each other.

    These objects are:
    * a managed dictionary, which is thread-safe and can be accessed
      by independent processes and/or threads.
      (https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing.Manager)
      Apart from key,value pairs, the dictionary itself contains two managed lists:
       * `pbars`, a list strings for the independent progress report lines (one per process called by `delayed`)
       * `indices_of_free_pbars`, a list of booleans to check which `pbars` are free before using them to report
    * a threading.Thread-object, https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html#threading.Thread.
      It is instantiated with method called `work` as the `target` parameter (Thread(target=work)). The
      method `work` is created on-the-fly depending on whether we're updating to a terminal (update via print() to stdout)
      or to a notebook (update via a Textwidget).
    * a threading.Event-object, https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html#threading.Event.
      It is exit event; the flag that will tell the thread's target method (work) to exit the updating process. I.e.
      work contains a loop that runs with a sleep parameter and a while not exit_event

    The threading objects are created by _progressbardict2thread, which contains the updating logic
    and decisions in its environment dependent `work` method

    Parameters
    ----------
    progressbar_dict : dict
        A normal dictionary containing the fields needed to instantiate a managed
        progressbar dict. These fields are.
        * "n_trajs_total"
        * "n_trajs_done"
        * "n_trajs_done_prev"
        * "n_frames_done"
        * "start_time"
        * "n_jobs"
    progressbar : bool
        Toggle the progressbar. If False, all returned values
        will be None, telling downstream methods not to use
        a progressbar at all. This keeps the logic on whether
        to create a progressbar or not encapsulated here, and
        not in in the other methods.
