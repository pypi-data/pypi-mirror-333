Computation, bookkeeping, and manipulation
of residue-residue contacts.

The methods wrap around a modified version
of `mdtraj.compute_contacts` to extract
residue-residue distances. The modifications
consist in including the indices of the closest
atom-pairs in the returned values.

The classes contain and abstract these distances into
sense-making groups, offering methods to operate directly
on all residue-residue distances.

It is recommended to use higher-level methods of the API,
like those exposed by :obj:`mdciao.cli` to create
:obj:`ContactPair` or :obj:`ContactGroup` objects and
then use the methods stated above, but of course experienced
users can instantiate them directly.
