*cowpoke* is a package of Python build, extract, mapping, statistics, and analysis routines applicable to knowledge graphs, specifically [KBpedia](https://kbpedia.org/). The *cowpoke* package was developed as part of a 75-part series of electronic notebooks entitled [*Cooking with Python
and KBpedia*](https://www.mkbergman.com/cooking-with-python-and-kbpedia/). 

The electronic notebooks, which begin with installment #14, may be obtained from the [Jupyter Notebook repository](https://github.com/Cognonto/CWPK). There is much explanatory material in those notebooks regarding how the *cowpoke* code was constructed and what it does.

### Installation
Besides downloading and building the package locally, you may install the *cowpoke* package directly:

<code>pip install cowpoke</code>
