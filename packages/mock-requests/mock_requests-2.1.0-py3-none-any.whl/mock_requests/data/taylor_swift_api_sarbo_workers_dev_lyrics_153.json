{"song_id": 153, "song_title": "Sweet Nothing", "lyrics": "I spy with my little tired eye\nTiny as a firefly\nA pebble that we picked up last July\nDown deep inside your pocket\nWe almost forgot it\nDoes it ever miss Wicklow sometimes\nOoh\nOoh\n\nThey said the end is coming\nEveryones up to something\nI find myself running home to your\nSweet nothings\n\nOutside theyre push and shoving\nYoure in the kitchen humming\nAll that you ever wanted from me was\nSweet nothing\n\nOn the way home\nI wrote a poem\nYou say What a mind\nThis happens all the time\nOoh\nOoh\n\nCause they said the end is coming\nEveryones up to something\nI find myself running home to your\nSweet nothings\n\nOutside theyre push and shoving\nYoure in the kitchen humming\nAll that you ever wanted from me was\nNothing\n\nIndustry disrupters and soul deconstructors\nAnd smooth-talking hucksters\nOut glad-handing each other\nAnd the voices that implore\nYou should be doing more\nTo you I can admit\nThat Im just too soft for all of it\nOoh\n\nThey said the end is coming\nEveryones up to something\nI find myself running home to your\nSweet nothings\n\nOutside theyre push and shoving\nYoure in the kitchen humming\nAll that you ever wanted from me was\nSweet nothing\n\nThey said the end is coming They said the end is coming\nEveryones up to something Everyones up to something\nI find myself running home to your\nSweet nothings\n\nOutside theyre push and shoving Outside theyre push and shoving\nYoure in the kitchen humming Youre in the kitchen humming\nAll that you ever wanted from me was\nSweet nothing"}
