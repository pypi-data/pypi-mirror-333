{"song_id": 34, "song_title": "Change", "lyrics": "And its a sad picture\nThe final blow hits you\nSomebody else gets what you wanted again\nAnd you know its all the same\nAnother time and place\nRepeating history and youre getting sick of it\n\nBut I believe in whatever you do\nAnd Ill do anything to see it through\n\nBecause these things will change\nCan you feel it now\nThese walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down\nThis revolution the time will come\nFor us to finally win\nAnd well sing hallelujah well sing hallelujah\nOh oh\n\nSo weve been outnumbered\nRaided and now cornered\nIts hard to fight when the fight aint fair\nWere getting stronger now\nFind things they never found\nThey might be bigger\nBut were faster and never scared\n\nYou can walk away say we dont need this\nBut theres something in your eyes says we can beat this\n\nCause these things will change\nCan you feel it now\nThese walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down\nThis revolution the time will come\nFor us to finally win\nAnd well sing hallelujah well sing hallelujah\nOh oh\n\nTonight we stand get off our knees\nFight for what weve worked for all these years\nAnd the battle was long its the fight of our lives\nBut well stand up champions tonight\n\nIt was the night things changed\nCan you see it now\nThese walls that they put up to hold us back fell down\nIts a revolution throw your hands up\nCause we never gave in\nAnd well sing hallelujah we sang hallelujah\nHallelujah"}
