{"song_id": 33, "song_title": "Fifteen", "lyrics": "You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors\nIts the morning of your very first day\nYou say Hi to your friends you aint seen in a while\nTry and stay out of everybodys way\nIts your freshman year and youre gonna be here\nFor the next four years in this town\nHoping one of those senior boys will wink at you and say\nYou know I havent seen you around before\n\nCause when youre fifteen and somebody tells you they love you\nYoure gonna believe them\nAnd when youre fifteen\nFeeling like theres nothing to figure out\nWell count to ten take it in\nThis is life before you know who youre gonna be\nFifteen\n\nYou sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail\nAnd soon enough youre best friends\nLaughing at the other girls who think theyre so cool\nWell be out of here as soon as we can\nAnd then youre on your very first date and hes got a car\nAnd youre feeling like flying\nAnd your mammas waiting up and youre thinking hes the one\nAnd youre dancing round your room when the night ends\nWhen the night ends\n\nCause when youre fifteen and somebody tells you they love you\nYoure gonna believe them\nWhen youre fifteen\nAnd your first kiss makes your head spin round\nBut in your life youll do things greater than dating the boy on the football team\nBut I didnt know it at fifteen\n\nWhen all you wanted was to be wanted\nWish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now\n\nBack then I swore I was gonna marry him someday\nBut I realized some bigger dreams of mine\nAnd Abigail gave everything she had to a boy who changed his mind\nAnd we both cried\n\nCause when youre fifteen and somebody tells you they love you\nYoure gonna believe them\nAnd when youre fifteen\nDont forget to look before you fall\nIve found time can heal most anything\nAnd you just might find who youre supposed to be\nI didnt know who I was supposed to be at fifteen\n\nLa la la la la la la\nLa la la la la la la\nLa la la la la la la\n\nYour very first day\nTake a deep breath girl\nTake a deep breath as you walk through the doors"}
