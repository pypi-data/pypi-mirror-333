{"song_id": 59, "song_title": "The Very First Night (Taylor\u2019s version)", "lyrics": "I wish I could fly\nId pick you up and wed go back in time\nId write this in the sky\nI miss you like it was the very first night\n\nAnd so it goes\nEvery weekend this same party\nI never go alone and I dont seem brokenhearted\nMy friends all say they know everything Im going through\nI drive down different roads\nBut they all lead back to you\nCause they dont know about the night in the hotel\nThey werent riding in the car when we both fell\nDidnt read the note on the Polaroid picture\nThey dont know how much I miss you\n\nI wish I could fly\nId pick you up and wed go back in time\nId write this in the sky\nI miss you like it was the very first night\n\nAnd so it was\nWe never saw it coming\nNot trying to fall in love\nBut we did like children running\nBack then we didnt know we were built to fall apart\nWe broke the status quo then we broke each others hearts\nBut dont forget about the night out in LA\nDanced in the kitchen chased me down through the hallway\nNo one knows about the words that we whispered\nNo one knows how much I miss you\n\nI wish I could fly\nId pick you up and wed go back in time\nId write this in the sky\nI miss you like it was the very first night\n\nTake me away take me away\nTake me away to you to you\nTake me away take me away\nTake me away to you to you\n\nI remember the night at the hotel\nI was riding in the car when we both fell\nIm the one on the phone as you whisper\nDo you know how much I miss you\nI wish that we could go back in time\nAnd Id say to you\nI miss you like it was the very first night\n\nI wish I could fly\nId pick you up and wed go back in time\nId write this in the sky\nI miss you like it was the very first night\nTake me away take me away\nTake me away to you to you\nTake me away take me away\nTake me away to you to you"}
