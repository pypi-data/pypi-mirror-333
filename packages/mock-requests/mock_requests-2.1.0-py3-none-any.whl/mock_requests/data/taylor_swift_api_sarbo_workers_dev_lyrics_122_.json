{"song_id": 122, "song_title": "cardigan", "lyrics": "Vintage tee brand new phone\nHigh heels on cobblestones\nWhen you are young they assume you know nothing\nSequin smile black lipstick\nSensual politics\nWhen you are young they assume you know nothing\n\nBut I knew you\nDancing in your Levis\nDrunk under a streetlight I\nI knew you\nHand under my sweatshirt\nBaby kiss it better I\n\nAnd when I felt like I was an old cardigan under someones bed\nYou put me on and said I was your favorite\nA friend to all is a friend to none\nChase two girls lose the one\nWhen you are young they assume you know nothing\n\nBut I knew you\nPlaying hide-and-seek and\nGiving me your weekends\nI I knew you\nYour heartbeat on the High Line\nOnce in twenty lifetimes I\n\nAnd when I felt like I was an old cardigan under someones bed\nYou put me on and said I was your favorite\n\nTo kiss in cars and downtown bars\nWas all we needed\nYou drew stars around my scars\nBut now Im bleeding\n\nCause I knew you\nStepping on the last train\nMarked me like a bloodstain I\nI knew you\nTried to change the ending\nPeter losing Wendy\nI I knew you\nLeaving like a father\nRunning like water I\nAnd when you are young they assume you know nothing\n\nBut I knew youd linger like a tattoo kiss\nI knew youd haunt all of my what-ifs\nThe smell of smoke would hang around this long\nCause I knew everything when I was young\nI knew Id curse you for the longest time\nChasing shadows in the grocery line\nI knew youd miss me once the thrill expired\nAnd youd be standing in my front porch light\nAnd I knew youd come back to me\nYoud come back to me\nAnd youd come back to me\nAnd youd come back\n\nAnd when I felt like I was an old cardigan under someones bed\nYou put me on and said I was your favorite"}
