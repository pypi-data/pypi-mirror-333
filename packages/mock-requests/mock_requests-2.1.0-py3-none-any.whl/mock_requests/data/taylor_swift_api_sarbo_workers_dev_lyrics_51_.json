{"song_id": 51, "song_title": "Last Kiss", "lyrics": "I still remember the look on your face\nLit through the darkness at 158\nThe words that you whispered\nFor just us to know\nYou told me you loved me\nSo why did you go away\nAway\n\nI do recall now the smell of the rain\nFresh on the pavement\nI ran off the plane\nThat July 9th\nThe beat of your heart\nIt jumps through your shirt\nI can still feel your arms\n\nBut now Ill go sit on the floor\nWearing your clothes\nAll that I know is\nI dont know how to be something you miss\nI never thought wed have a last kiss\nNever imagined wed end like this\nYour name forever the name on my lips\n\nI do remember the swing of your step\nThe life of the party youre showing off again\nAnd I roll my eyes and then\nYou pull me in\nIm not much for dancing\nBut for you I did\n\nBecause I love your handshake meeting my father\nI love how you walk with your hands in your pockets\nHow youd kiss me when I was in the middle of saying something\nTheres not a day I dont miss those rude interruptions\n\nAnd Ill go sit on the floor\nWearing your clothes\nAll that I know is\nI dont know how to be something you miss\nI never thought wed have a last kiss\nI never imagined wed end like this\nYour name forever the name on my lips\n\nSo Ill watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep\nAnd I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe\nAnd I keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are\nHope its nice where you are\n\nAnd I hope the sun shines\nAnd its a beautiful day\nAnd something reminds you\nYou wish you had stayed\nYou can plan for a change in weather and time\nBut I never planned on you changing your mind\n\nSo Ill go sit on the floor\nWearing your clothes\nAll that I know is\nI dont know how to be something you miss\nI never thought wed have a last kiss\nI never imagined wed end like this\nYour name forever the name on my lips\n\nJust like our last kiss\nForever the name on my lips\nForever the name on my lips\n\nJust like our last"}
