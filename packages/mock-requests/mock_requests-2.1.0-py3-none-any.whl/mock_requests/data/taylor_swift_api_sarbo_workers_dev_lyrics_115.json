{"song_id": 115, "song_title": "Daylight", "lyrics": "My love was as cruel as the cities I lived in\nEveryone looked worse in the light\nThere are so many lines that Ive crossed unforgiven\nIll tell you the truth but never goodbye\n\nI dont wanna look at anything else now that I saw you\nI dont wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you\nIve been sleeping so long in a twenty-year dark night\nAnd now I see daylight I only see daylight\n\nLuck of the draw only draws the unlucky\nAnd so I became the butt of the joke\nI wounded the good and I trusted the wicked\nClearing the air I breathed in the smoke\nMaybe you ran with the wolves and refused to settle down\nMaybe Ive stormed out of every single room in this town\nThrew out our cloaks and our daggers because its morning now\nIts brighter now now\n\nI dont wanna look at anything else now that I saw you\nI can never look away\nI dont wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you\nThings will never be the same\nIve been sleeping so long in a twenty-year dark night\nNow Im wide awake\nAnd now I see daylight daylight I only see daylight daylight\nI only see daylight daylight daylight daylight\nI only see daylight daylight daylight daylight\n\nAnd I can still see it all In my mind\nAll of you all of me Intertwined\nI once believed love would be Black and white\nBut its golden Golden\nAnd I can still see it all In my head\nBack and forth from New York Sneaking in your bed\nI once believed love would be Burning red\nBut its golden\nLike daylight like daylight\nLike daylight daylight\n\nI dont wanna look at anything else now that I saw you\nI can never look away\nI dont wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you\nThings will never be the same\nIve been sleeping so long in a twenty-year dark night\nNow Im wide awake\nAnd now I see daylight I see daylight I only see daylight Ah\nI only see daylight daylight daylight daylight\nI only see daylight daylight daylight daylight Ah\nAnd I can still see it all\nI only see daylight daylight daylight daylight\nAnd I can still see it all back and forth from New York\nI only see daylight daylight daylight daylight\nI once believed love would be burning red\n\nLike daylight\nIts golden like daylight\nYou gotta step into the daylight and let it go\nJust let it go let it go\nI wanna be defined by the things that I love\nNot the things I hate\nNot the things that Im afraid of Im afraid of\nNot the things that haunt me in the middle of the night\nI I just think that\nYou are what you love\n"}
