{"song_id": 48, "song_title": "Dear John", "lyrics": "Long were the nights\nWhen my days once revolved around you\nCounting my footsteps\nPraying the floor wont fall through\nAgain\n\nAnd my mother accused me of losing my mind\nBut I swore I was fine\n\nYou paint me a blue sky\nAnd go back and turn it to rain\nAnd I lived in your chess game\nBut you changed the rules every day\n\nWonderin which version of you I might get on the phone tonight\nWell I stopped pickin up and this song is to let you know why\n\nDear John\nI see it all now that youre gone\nDont you think I was too young to be messed\nWith\nThe girl in the dress\nCried the whole way home\nI shouldve known\n\nWell maybe its me\nAnd my blind optimism\nTo blame\nOr maybe its you and your sick need\nTo give love then take it away\n\nAnd youll add my name\nTo your long list of traitors\nWho dont understand\nAnd I look back in regret\nHow I ignored when they said\nRun as fast as you can\n\nDear John\nI see it all now that youre gone\nDont you think I was too young to be messed\nWith\nThe girl in the dress\nCried the whole way home\n\nDear John\nI see it all now It was wrong\nDont you think nineteens too young to be played\nBy your dark twisted games\nWhen I loved you so\nI shouldve known\n\nYou are an expert at Sorry\nAnd keeping lines blurry\nNever impressed by me acing your tests\nAll the girls that youve run dry\nHave tired lifeless eyes\nCause youve burned them out\n\nBut I took your matches\nBefore fire could catch me\nSo dont look now\nIm shining like fireworks\nOver your sad empty town\n\nDear John\nI see it all now that youre gone\nDont you think I was too young to be messed\nWith\nThe girl in the dress\nCried the whole way home\n\nI see it all now that youre gone\nDont you think I was too young to be messed\nWith\nThe girl in the dress\nWrote you a song\nYou shouldve known\n\nYou shouldve known\nDont you think I was too young\nYou shouldve known"}
