{"song_id": 176, "song_title": "Hits Different", "lyrics": "I washed my hands of us at the club\nYou made a mess of me\nI pictured you with other girls in love\nThen threw up on the street\nLike waiting for a bus that never shows\nYou just start walkin on\nThey say that if its right you know\nEach bar plays our song\nNothing has ever felt so wrong\n\nOh my love is a lie\nShit my friends say to get me by\nIt hits different\nIt hits different this time\nCatastrophic blues\nMovin on was always easy for me to do\nIt hits different\nIt hits different cause its you\n\nCause its you\n\nI used to switch out these Kens Id just ghost\nRip the band-aid off and skip town like an asshole outlaw\nFreedom felt like summer then on the coast\nNow the sun burns my heart and the sand hurts my feelings\nAnd I never dont cry And I never dont cry at the bar\nYeah my sadness is contagious My sadness is contagious\nI slur your name til someone puts me in a car\nI stopped receiving invitations\n\nOh my love is a lie\nShit my friends say to get me by\nIt hits different\nIt hits different this time\nCatastrophic blues\nMovin on was always easy for me to do\nIt hits different\nIt hits different cause its you\n\nCause its you\n\nI find the artifacts cried over a hat\nCursed the space that I needed\nI trace the evidence make it make some sense\nWhy the wound is still bleedin\nYou were the one that I loved\nDont need another metaphor its simple enough\nA wrinkle in time like the crease by your eyes\nThis is why they shouldnt kill off the main guy\nDreams of your hair and your stare and sense of belief\nIn the good in the world you once believed in me\nAnd I felt you and I held you for a while\nBet I could still melt your world\nArgumentative antithetical dream girl\n\nI heard your key turn in the door down the hallway\nIs that your key in the door\nIs it okay Is it you\nOr have they come to take me away\nTo take me away\n\nOh my love is a lie\nShit my friends say to get me by\nIt hits different It hits different\nIt hits different this time\nCatastrophic blues\nMovin on was always easy for me to do\nIt hits different It hits different\nIt hits different cause its you\n\nOh my love is a lie\nShit my friends say to get me by\nCause its you\nCatastrophic blues\nMovin on was always easy for me to do\nIt hits different Yeah\nIt hits different cause its you"}
