{"song_id": 101, "song_title": "Cornelia Street", "lyrics": "We were in the backseat\nDrunk on something stronger than the drinks in the bar\nI rent a place on Cornelia Street\nI say casually in the car\nWe were a fresh page on the desk\nFilling in the blanks as we go\nAs if the street lights pointed in an arrow head\nLeading us home\n\nAnd I hope I never lose you hope it never ends\nId never walk Cornelia Street again\nThats the kinda heartbreak time could never mend\nId never walk Cornelia Street again\nAnd baby I get mystified by how this city screams your name\nAnd baby Im so terrified of if you ever walk away\nId never walk Cornelia Street again\nId never walk Cornelia Street again\n\nWindows flung right open autumn air\nJacket round my shoulders is yours\nWe bless the rains on Cornelia Street\nMemorize the creaks in the floor\nBack when we were card sharks playing games\nI thought you were leading me on\nI packed my bags left Cornelia Street\nBefore you even knew I was gone\n\nBut then you called showed your hand\nI turned around before I hit the tunnel\nSat on the roof you and I\n\nI hope I never lose you hope it never ends\nId never walk Cornelia Street again\nThats the kinda heartbreak time could never mend\nId never walk Cornelia Street again\nAnd baby I get mystified by how this city screams your name\nAnd baby Im so terrified of if you ever walk away\nId never walk Cornelia Street again\nId never walk Cornelia Street again\n\nYou hold my hand on the street\nWalk me back to that apartment\nYears ago we were just inside\nBarefoot in the kitchen\nSacred new beginnings\nThat became my religion listen\n\nI hope I never lose you\nId never walk Cornelia Street again\nOh never again\nAnd baby I get mystified by how this city screams your name\nAnd baby Im so terrified of if you ever walk away\nId never walk Cornelia Street again\nId never walk Cornelia Street again\n\nI dont wanna lose you Hope it never ends\nId never walk Cornelia Street again\nI dont wanna lose you Yeah\n\nI rent a place on Cornelia Street\nI say casually in the car"}
