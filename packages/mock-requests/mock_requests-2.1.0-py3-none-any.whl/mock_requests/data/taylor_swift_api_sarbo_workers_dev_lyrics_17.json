{"song_id": 17, "song_title": "Cold as You", "lyrics": "You have a way of coming easily to me\nAnd when you take you take the very best of me\nSo I start a fight cause I need to feel something\nAnd you do what you want cause Im not what you wanted\n\nOh what a shame what a rainy ending given to a perfect day\nJust walk away aint no use defending words that you will never say\nAnd now that Im sitting here thinking it through\nIve never been anywhere cold as you\n\nYou put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray\nAnd I stood there loving you and wished them all away\nAnd you come away with a great little story\nOf a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you\n\nOh what a shame what a rainy ending given to a perfect day\nSo just walk away aint no use defending words that you will never say\nAnd now that Im sitting here thinking it through\nIve never been anywhere cold as you\n\nYou never did give a damn thing honey but I cried cried for you\nAnd I know you wouldnt have told nobody if I died died for you died for you\n\nOh what a shame what a rainy ending given to a perfect day\nEvery smile you fake is so condescending counting all the scars you made\nAnd now that Im sitting here thinking it through\nIve never been anywhere cold as you"}
