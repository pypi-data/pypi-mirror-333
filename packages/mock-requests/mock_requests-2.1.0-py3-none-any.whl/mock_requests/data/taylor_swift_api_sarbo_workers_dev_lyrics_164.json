{"song_id": 164, "song_title": "Paris", "lyrics": "Your ex-friends sister met someone at a club and he kissed her\nTurns out it was that guy you hooked up with ages ago some wannabe Z-lister\nAnd all the outfits were terrible\n2003 unbearable\nDid you see the photos\nNo I didnt but thanks though\n\nIm so in love that I might stop breathing\nDrew a map on your bedroom ceiling\nNo I didnt see the news\nCause we were somewhere else\nStumble down pretend alleyways\nCheap wine make believe its champagne\nI was taken by the view\nLike we were in Paris\nLike we were somewhere else\nLike we were in Paris oh\nWe were somewhere else\n\nPrivacy sign on the door\nAnd on my page and on the whole world\nRomance is not dead\nIf you keep it just yours\nLevitate above all the messes made\nSit quiet by my side in the shade\nAnd not the kind thats thrown\nI mean the kind under where a tree has grown\n\nIm so in love that I might stop breathing\nDrew a map on your bedroom ceiling\nNo I didnt see the news\nCause we were somewhere else\nStumble down pretend alleyways\nCheap wine make believe its champagne\nI was taken by the view\nLike we were in Paris\nLike we were somewhere else\nLike we were in Paris oh\nWe were somewhere else\n\nI want to brainwash you into loving me forever\nI want to transport you to somewhere the cultures clever\nConfess my truth in swooping sloping cursive letters\nLet the only flashing lights\nBe the tower at midnight\nIn my mind\n\nWe drew a map on your bedroom ceiling\nNo I didnt see the news\nCause we were somewhere else\nIn an alleyway\nDrinking champagne\nCause we were in Paris\nYes we were somewhere else\nMy love we were in Paris\nYes we were somewhere else"}
