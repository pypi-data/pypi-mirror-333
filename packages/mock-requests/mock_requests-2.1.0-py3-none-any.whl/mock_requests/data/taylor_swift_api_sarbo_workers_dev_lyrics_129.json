{"song_id": 129, "song_title": "this is me trying", "lyrics": "Ive been having a hard time adjusting\nI had the shiniest wheels now theyre rusting\nI didnt know if youd care if I came back\nI have a lot of regrets about that\nPulled the car off the road to the lookout\nCouldve followed my fears all the way down\nAnd maybe I dont quite know what to say\nBut Im here in your doorway\n\nI just wanted you to know\nThat this is me trying\nI just wanted you to know\nThat this is me trying\n\nThey told me all of my cages were mental\nSo I got wasted like all my potential\nAnd my words shoot to kill when Im mad\nI have a lot of regrets about that\nI was so ahead of the curve the curve became a sphere\nFell behind all my classmates and I ended up here\nPourin out my heart to a stranger\nBut I didnt pour the whiskey\n\nI just wanted you to know\nThat this is me trying\nI just wanted you to know\nThat this is me trying\n\nAt least Im trying\n\nAnd its hard to be at a party\nWhen I feel like an open wound\nIts hard to be anywhere these days\nWhen all I want is you\nYoure a flashback in a film reel\nOn the one screen in my town\n\nAnd I just wanted you to know\nThat this is me trying And maybe I dont quite know what to say\nI just wanted you to know\nThat this is me trying\n\nAt least Im trying"}
