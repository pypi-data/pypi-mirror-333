{"song_id": 128, "song_title": "invisible string", "lyrics": "Green was the color of the grass where I used to read at Centennial Park\nI used to think I would meet somebody there\nTeal was the color of your shirt when you were 16 at the yogurt shop\nYou used to work at to make a little money\n\nTime\nCurious time\nGave me no compasses\nGave me no signs\nWere there clues I didnt see\nAnd isnt it just so pretty to think\nAll along there was some\nInvisible string\nTying you to me\n\nBad was the blood of the song in the cab on your first trip to LA\nYou ate at my favorite spot for dinner\nBold was the waitress on our three-year trip getting lunch down by the Lakes\nShe said I looked like an American singer\n\nTime\nMystical time\nCutting me open then healing me fine\nWere there clues I didnt see\nAnd isnt it just so pretty to think\nAll along there was some\nInvisible string\nTying you to me\n\nA string that pulled me\nOut of all the wrong arms right into that dive bar\nSomething wrapped all of my past mistakes in barbed wire\nChains around my demons\nWool to brave the seasons\nOne single thread of gold tied me to you\n\nCold was the steel of my axe to grind for the boys who broke my heart\nNow I send their babies presents\nGold was the color of the leaves when I showed you around Centennial Park\nHell was the journey but it brought me heaven\n\nTime\nWondrous time\nGave me the blues and then purple-pink skies\nAnd its cool\nBaby with me\nAnd isnt it just so pretty to think\nAll along there was some\nInvisible string\nTying you to me\n\nOoh-ooh-ooh-ooh\nMe\nOoh-ooh-ooh-ooh\n\nAh-ah-ah\nAh-ah-ah"}
