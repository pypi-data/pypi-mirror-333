{"song_id": 21, "song_title": "Should\\'ve Said No", "lyrics": "Its strange to think the songs we used to sing\nThe smiles the flowers everything is gone\nYesterday I found out about you\nEven now just looking at you feels wrong\n\nYou say that youd take it all back given one chance\nIt was a moment of weakness and you said Yes\n\nYou shouldve said No you shouldve gone home\nYou shouldve thought twice fore you let it all go\nYou shouldve known that word\nBout what you did with herd\nGet back to me get back to me\nAnd I shouldve been there in the back of your mind\nI shouldnt be asking myself Why\nYou shouldnt be begging for forgiveness at my feet\nYou shouldve said No baby and you might still have me\n\nYou can see that Ive been crying\nAnd baby you know all the right things to say\nBut do you honestly expect me to believe\nWe could ever be the same\n\nYou say that the past is the past you need one chance\nIt was a moment of weakness and you said Yes\n\nYou shouldve said No you shouldve gone home\nYou shouldve thought twice fore you let it all go\nYou shouldve known that word\nBout what you did with herd\nGet back to me get back to me\nAnd I shouldve been there in the back of your mind\nI shouldnt be asking myself Why\nYou shouldnt be begging for forgiveness at my feet\nYou shouldve said No baby and you might still have me\n\nI cant resist\nBefore you go tell me this\nWas it worth it\nWas she worth this\n\nNo no no no\n\nYou shouldve said No you shouldve gone home\nYou shouldve thought twice fore you let it all go\nYou shouldve known that word\nBout what you did with herd\nGet back to me get back to me\nAnd I shouldve been there in the back of your mind\nI shouldnt be asking myself Why\nYou shouldnt be begging for forgiveness at my feet\nYou shouldve said No baby and you might still have me"}
