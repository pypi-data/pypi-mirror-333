{"song_id": 13, "song_title": "Tim McGraw", "lyrics": "He said the way my blue eyes shined\nPut those Georgia stars to shame that night\nI said Thats a lie\nJust a boy in a Chevy truck\nThat had a tendency of gettin stuck\nOn back roads at night\nAnd I was right there beside him all summer long\nAnd then the time we woke up to find that summer gone\n\nBut when you think Tim McGraw\nI hope you think my favorite song\nThe one we danced to all night long\nThe moon like a spotlight on the lake\nWhen you think happiness\nI hope you think that little black dress\nThink of my head on your chest\nAnd my old faded blue jeans\nWhen you think Tim McGraw\nI hope you think of me\n\nSeptember saw a month of tears\nAnd thankin God that you werent here\nTo see me like that\nBut in a box beneath my bed\nIs a letter that you never read\nFrom three summers back\nIts hard not to find it all a little bittersweet\nAnd lookin back on all of that its nice to believe\n\nWhen you think Tim McGraw\nI hope you think my favorite song\nThe one we danced to all night long\nThe moon like a spotlight on the lake\nWhen you think happiness\nI hope you think that little black dress\nThink of my head on your chest\nAnd my old faded blue jeans\nWhen you think Tim McGraw\nI hope you think of me\n\nAnd Im back for the first time since then\nIm standin on your street\nAnd theres a letter left on your doorstep\nAnd the first thing that youll read is\n\nWhen you think Tim McGraw\nI hope you think my favorite song\nSomeday youll turn your radio on\nI hope it takes you back to that place\n\nWhen you think happiness\nI hope you think that little black dress\nThink of my head on your chest\nAnd my old faded blue jeans\nWhen you think Tim McGraw\nI hope you think of me\n\nOh think of me\nMmmm\n\nHe said the way my blue eyes shined\nPut those Georgia stars to shame that night\nI said Thats a lie"}
