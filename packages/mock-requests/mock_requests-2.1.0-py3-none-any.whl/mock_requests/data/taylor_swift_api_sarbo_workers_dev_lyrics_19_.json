{"song_id": 19, "song_title": "Tied Together with a Smile", "lyrics": "Seems the only one who doesnt see your beauty\nIs the face in the mirror looking back at you\nYou walk around here thinking youre not pretty\nBut thats not true cause I know you\n\nHold on baby youre losing it\nThe waters high youre jumping into it\nAnd letting go\nAnd no one knows\nThat you cry but you dont tell anyone\nThat you might not be the golden one\nAnd youre tied together with a smile\nBut youre coming undone\n\nI guess its true that love was all you wanted\nCause youre giving it away like its extra change\nHoping it will end up in his pocket\nBut he leaves you out like a penny in the rain\n\nOh cause its not his price to pay\nIts not his price to pay\n\nHold on baby youre losing it\nThe waters high youre jumping into it\nAnd letting go\nAnd no one knows\nThat you cry but you dont tell anyone\nThat you might not be the golden one\nAnd youre tied together with a smile\nBut youre coming undone\n\nHold on baby youre losing it\nThe waters high youre jumping into it\nAnd letting go\nAnd no one knows\nThat you cry but you dont tell anyone\nThat you might not be the golden one\nAnd youre tied together with a smile\nBut youre coming undone\n\nYoure tied together with a smile\nBut youre coming undone\nGoodbye baby\nWith a smile baby baby"}
