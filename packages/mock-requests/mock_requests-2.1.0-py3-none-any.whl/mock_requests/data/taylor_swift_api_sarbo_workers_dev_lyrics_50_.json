{"song_id": 50, "song_title": "Innocent", "lyrics": "I guess you really did it this time\nLeft yourself in your warpath\nLost your balance on a tightrope\nLost your mind tryin to get it back\n\nWasnt it easier in your lunchbox days\nAlways a bigger bed to crawl into\nWasnt it beautiful when you believed in everything\nAnd everybody believed in you\n\nIts alright just wait and see\nYour string of lights is still bright to me\nOh who you are is not where youve been\nYoure still an innocent\nYoure still an innocent\n\nDid some things you cant speak of\nBut at night you live it all again\nYou wouldnt be shattered on the floor now\nIf only you had seen what you know now then\n\nWasnt it easier in your firefly-catchin days\nWhen everything out of reach\nSomeone bigger brought down to you\nWasnt it beautiful runnin wild til you fell asleep\nBefore the monsters caught up to you\n\nIts alright just wait and see\nYour string of lights is still bright to me\nOh who you are is not what youve been\nYoure still an innocent\nIts okay life is a tough crowd\n32 and still growin up now\nWho you are is not what you did\nYoure still an innocent\n\nTime turns flames to embers\nYoull have new Septembers\nEvery one of us has messed up too\nLives change like the weather\nI hope you remember\nToday is never too late to be brand new\n\nIts alright just wait and see\nYour string of lights is still bright to me\nOh who you are is not what youve been\nYoure still an innocent\nIts okay life is a tough crowd\n32 and still growin up now\nWho you are is not what you did\nYoure still an innocent\nYoure still an innocent\n\nLost your balance on a tightrope\nIts never too late to get it back"}
