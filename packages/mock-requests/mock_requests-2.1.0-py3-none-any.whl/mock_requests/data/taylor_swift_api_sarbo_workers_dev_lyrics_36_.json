{"song_id": 36, "song_title": "Forever & Always", "lyrics": "Once upon a time\nI believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye\nAnd we caught onto something\nI hold onto the night\nYou looked me in the eye and told me you loved me\nWere you just kidding\nCause it seems to me\nThis thing is breaking down we almost never speak\nI dont feel welcome anymore\nBaby what happened Please tell me\nCause one second it was perfect\nNow youre halfway out the door\n\nAnd I stare at the phone he still hasnt called\nAnd then you feel so low you cant feel nothing at all\nAnd you flashback to when he said forever and always\nOh and it rains in your bedroom\nEverything is wrong\nIt rains when youre here and it rains when youre gone\nCause I was there when you said forever and always\n\nWas I out of line\nDid I say something way too honest made you run and hide\nLike a scared little boy\nI looked into your eyes\nThought I knew you for a minute now Im not so sure\nSo heres to everything coming down to nothing\nHeres to silence that cuts me to the core\nWhere is this going\nThought I knew for a minute but I dont anymore\n\nAnd I stare at the phone he still hasnt called\nAnd then you feel so low you cant feel nothing at all\nAnd you flashback to when he said forever and always\nOh and it rains in your bedroom\nEverything is wrong\nIt rains when youre here and it rains when youre gone\nCause I was there when you said forever and always\nYou didnt mean it baby I dont think so\n\nOh back up baby back up\nDid you forget everything\nBack up baby back up\nDid you forget everything\n\nCause it rains in your bedroom\nEverything is wrong\nIt rains when youre here and it rains when youre gone\nCause I was there when you said forever and always\nOh I stare at the phone he still hasnt called\nAnd then you feel so low you cant feel nothing at all\nAnd you flashback to when we said forever and always\n\nAnd it rains in your bedroom\nEverything is wrong\nIt rains when youre here and it rains when youre gone\nCause I was there when you said forever and always\nYou didnt mean it baby\nYou said forever and always yeah"}
