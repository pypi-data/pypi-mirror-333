{"song_id": 49, "song_title": "Mean", "lyrics": "You with your words like knives\nAnd swords and weapons that you use against me\nYou have knocked me off my feet again\nGot me feeling like Im nothing\nYou with your voice like nails on a chalkboard\nCalling me out when Im wounded\nYou picking on the weaker man\n\nWell you can take me down\nWith just one single blow\nBut you dont know what you dont know\n\nSomeday Ill be living in a big old city\nAnd all youre ever gonna be is mean\nSomeday Ill be big enough so you cant hit me\nAnd all youre ever gonna be is mean\nWhy you gotta be so mean\n\nYou with your switching sides\nAnd your wildfire lies and your humiliation\nYou have pointed out my flaws again\nAs if I dont already see them\nI walk with my head down trying to block you out\nCause Ill never impress you\nI just wanna feel okay again\n\nI bet you got pushed around\nSomebody made you cold\nBut the cycle ends right now\nCause you cant lead me down that road\nAnd you dont know what you dont know\n\nSomeday Ill be living in a big old city\nAnd all youre ever gonna be is mean\nSomeday Ill be big enough so you cant hit me\nAnd all youre ever gonna be is mean\nWhy you gotta be so mean\n\nAnd I can see you years from now in a bar\nTalking over a football game\nWith that same big loud opinion\nBut nobodys listening\nWashed up and ranting about the same old bitter things\nDrunk and grumbling on about how I cant sing\nBut all you are is mean\nAll you are is mean\nAnd a liar and pathetic and alone in life\nAnd mean and mean and mean and mean\n\nBut someday Ill be living in a big old city\nAnd all youre ever gonna be is mean yeah\n\nSomeday Ill be big enough so you cant hit me\nAnd all youre ever gonna be is mean\nWhy you gotta be so mean\nSomeday Ill be living in a big old city\nWhy you gotta be so mean\nAnd all youre ever gonna be is mean\nWhy you gotta be so mean\nSomeday Ill be big enough so you cant hit me\nWhy you gotta be so mean\nAnd all youre ever gonna be is mean\nWhy you gotta be so mean"}
