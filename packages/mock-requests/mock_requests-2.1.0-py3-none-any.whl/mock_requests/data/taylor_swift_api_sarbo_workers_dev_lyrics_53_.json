{"song_id": 53, "song_title": "Speak Now", "lyrics": "I am not the kind of girl\nWho should be rudely barging in on a white-veil occasion\nBut you are not the kind of boy\nWho should be marrying the wrong girl\n\nI sneak in and see your friends\nAnd her snotty little family all dressed in pastel\nAnd she is yelling at a bridesmaid\nSomewhere back inside a room\nWearing a gown shaped like a pastry\n\nThis is surely not what you thought it would be\nI lose myself in a daydream\nWhere I stand and say\n\nDont say Yes run away now\nIll meet you when youre out of the church at the back door\nDont wait or say a single vow\nYou need to hear me out\nAnd they said Speak now\n\nFond gestures are exchanged\nAnd the organ starts to play\nA song that sounds like a death march\nAnd I am hiding in the curtains\nIt seems that I was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be\n\nShe floats down the aisle like a pageant queen\nBut I know you wish it was me\nYou wish it was me\nDont you\n\nDont say Yes run away now\nIll meet you when youre out of the church at the back door\nDont wait or say a single vow\nYou need to hear me out\nAnd they said Speak now\nDont say Yes run away now\nIll meet you when youre out of the church at the back door\nDont wait or say a single vow\nYour time is running out\nAnd they said Speak now\n\nOh la la\nOh oh\nSay a single vow\n\nI hear the preacher say Speak now or forever hold your peace\nTheres the silence theres my last chance\nI stand up with shaky hands all eyes on me\nHorrified looks from everyone in the room\nBut Im only looking at you\n\nI am not the kind of girl\nWho should be rudely barging in on a white-veil occasion\nBut you are not the kind of boy\nWho should be marrying the wrong girl\n\nSo dont say Yes run away now\nIll meet you when youre out of the church at the back door\nDont wait or say a single vow\nYou need to hear me out\nAnd they said Speak now\nAnd you say Lets run away now\nIll meet you when Im out of my tux at the back door\nBaby I didnt say my vows\nSo glad you were around\nWhen they said Speak now"}
