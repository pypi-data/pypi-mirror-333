{"song_id": 137, "song_title": "willow", "lyrics": "Im like the water when your ship rolled in that night\nRough on the surface but you cut through like a knife\nAnd if it was an openshut case\nI never wouldve known from that look on your face\nLost in your current like a priceless wine\n\nThe more that you say the less I know\nWherever you stray I follow\nIm begging for you to take my hand\nWreck my plans thats my man\n\nLife was a willow and it bent right to your wind\nHead on the pillow I could feel you sneaking in\nAs if you were a mythical thing\nLike you were a trophy or a champion ring\nAnd there was one prize Id cheat to win\n\nThe more that you say the less I know\nWherever you stray I follow\nIm begging for you to take my hand\nWreck my plans thats my man\nYou know that my train could take you home\nAnywhere else is hollow\nIm begging for you to take my hand\nWreck my plans thats my man\n\nLife was a willow and it bent right to your wind\nThey count me out time and time again\nLife was a willow and it bent right to your wind\nBut I come back stronger than a 90s trend\n\nWait for the signal and Ill meet you after dark\nShow me the places where the others gave you scars\nNow this is an openshut case\nI guess I shouldve known from the look on your face\nEvery bait-and-switch was a work of art\n\nThe more that you say the less I know\nWherever you stray I follow\nIm begging for you to take my hand\nWreck my plans thats my man\nYou know that my train could take you home\nAnywhere else is hollow\nIm begging for you to take my hand\nWreck my plans thats my man\n\nThe more that you say the less I know\nWherever you stray I follow\nIm begging for you to take my hand\nWreck my plans thats my man\nYou know that my train could take you home\nAnywhere else is hollow\nIm begging for you to take my hand\nWreck my plans thats my man\n\nHey thats my man\nThats my man\nYeah thats my man\nEvery bait-and-switch was a work of art\nThats my man\nHey thats my man\nIm begging for you to take my hand\nWreck my plans thats my man"}
