{"song_id": 29, "song_title": "Tell Me Why", "lyrics": "I took a chance I took a shot\nAnd you might think Im bulletproof but Im not\nYou took a swing I took it hard\nAnd down here from the ground I see who you are\n\nIm sick and tired of your attitude\nIm feeling like I dont know you\nYou tell me that you love me then cut me down\nAnd I need you like a heartbeat\nBut you know you got a mean streak\nThat makes me run for cover when youre around\nAnd heres to you and your temper\nYes I remember what you said last night\nAnd I know that you see what youre doing to me\nTell me why\n\nYou could write a book on how to ruin someones perfect day\nWell I get so confused and frustrated\nForget what Im trying to say oh\n\nIm sick and tired of your reasons\nI got no one to believe in\nYou tell me that you want me then push me around\nAnd I need you like a heartbeat\nBut you know you got a mean streak\nThat makes me run for cover when youre around\nHeres to you and your temper\nYes I remember what you said last night\nAnd I know that you see what youre doing to me\nTell me why\n\nWhy do you have to make me feel small\nSo you can feel whole inside\nWhy do you have to put down my dreams\nSo youre the only thing on my mind\n\nIm sick and tired of your attitude\nIm feeling like I dont know you\nYou tell me that you want me then cut me down\nIm sick and tired of your reasons\nIve got no one to believe in\nYou ask me for my love then you push me around\nHeres to you and your temper\nYes I remember what you said last night\nAnd I know that you see what youre doing to me\nTell me why Why\nTell me why Why\n\nI take a step back let you go\nI told you Im not bulletproof\nNow you know"}
