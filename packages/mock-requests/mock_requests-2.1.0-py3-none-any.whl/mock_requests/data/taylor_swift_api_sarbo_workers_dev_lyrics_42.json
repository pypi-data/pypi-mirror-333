{"song_id": 42, "song_title": "Sparks Fly", "lyrics": "The way you move is like a full-on rainstorm\nAnd Im a house of cards\nYoure the kind of reckless\nThat should send me running\nBut I kinda know that I wont get far\nAnd you stood there in front of me\nJust close enough to touch\nClose enough to hope you couldnt see\nWhat I was thinking of\n\nDrop everything now\nMeet me in the pouring rain\nKiss me on the sidewalk\nTake away the pain\nCause I see sparks fly whenever you smile\nGet me with those green eyes baby as the lights go down\nGive me something thatll haunt me when youre not around\nCause I see sparks fly whenever you smile\n\nMy mind forgets to remind me\nYoure a bad idea\nYou touch me once and its really something\nYou find Im even better than you imagined I would be\nIm on my guard for the rest of the world\nBut with you I know its no good\nAnd I could wait patiently but I really wish you would\n\nDrop everything now\nMeet me in the pouring rain\nKiss me on the sidewalk\nTake away the pain\nCause I see sparks fly whenever you smile\nGet me with those green eyes baby as the lights go down\nGive me something thatll haunt me when youre not around\nCause I see sparks fly whenever you smile\n\nIll run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild\nJust keep on keeping your eyes on me its just wrong enough to make it feel right\nAnd lead me up the staircase\nWont you whisper soft and slow\nIm captivated by you baby like a firework show\n\nDrop everything now\nMeet me in the pouring rain\nKiss me on the sidewalk\nTake away the pain\nCause I see sparks fly whenever you smile\nGet me with those green eyes baby as the lights go down\nGive me something thatll haunt me when youre not around\nCause I see sparks fly whenever you smile\n\nAnd the sparks fly\nOh baby smile\nAnd the sparks fly"}
