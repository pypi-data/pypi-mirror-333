{"song_id": 172, "song_title": "You All Over Me", "lyrics": "Taylor Swift\nOnce the last drop of rain has dried off the pavement\nShouldnt I find a stain but I never do\nThe way the tires turn stones on old county roads\nThey leave em muddy underneath\nReminds me of you\nYou find graffiti on the walls of old bathroom stalls\nYou know you can scratch it right off\nIts how it used to be\nBut like the dollar in your pocket its been spent and traded in\nYou cant change where its been\nReminds me of me\n\nTaylor Swift and Maren Morris\nI lived and I learned\nHad you got burned\nHeld out and held on\nGod knows too long\nAnd wasted time lost tears\nSwore that Id get out of here\nBut no amount of freedom gets you clean\nIve still got you all over me\n\nThe best and worst day of June\nWas the one that I met you\nWith your hands in your pockets\nAnd your Dont you wish you had me grin\nWell I did so I smiled and I melted like a child\nNow every breath of air I breathe reminds me of then\n\nAnd I lived and I learned\nHad you got burned\nHeld out and held on\nGod knows too long\nAnd wasted time lost tears\nSwore that Id get out of here\nBut no amount of freedom gets you clean\nIve still got you all over me\n\nI lived and I learned\nAnd found out what it was to turn around\nAnd see that we\nWere never really meant to be\nSo I lied and I cried\nAnd I watched a part of myself die\nCause no amount of freedom gets you clean\nIve still got you all over me\nIve still got you all over me\nStill got you all over me"}
