{"song_id": 45, "song_title": "The Story Of Us", "lyrics": "I used to think one day wed tell the story of us\nHow we met and the sparks flew instantly\nAnd people would say Theyre the lucky ones\nI used to know my place was the spot next to you\nNow Im searching the room for an empty seat\nCause lately I dont even know what page youre on\n\nOh a simple complication\nMiscommunications lead to fall-out\nSo many things that I wish you knew\nSo many walls up I cant break through\n\nNow Im standing alone in a crowded room and were not speaking\nAnd Im dying to know is it killing you like its killing me yeah\nI dont know what to say since the twist of fate when it all broke down\nAnd the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now\n\nNext chapter\n\nHowd we end up this way\nSee me nervously pulling at my clothes and trying to look busy\nAnd youre doing your best to avoid me\nIm starting to think one day Ill tell the story of us\nHow I was losing my mind when I saw you here\nBut you held your pride like you shouldve held me\n\nOh Im scared to see the ending\nWhy are we pretending this is nothing\nId tell you I miss you but I dont know how\nIve never heard silence quite this loud\n\nNow Im standing alone in a crowded room and were not speaking\nAnd Im dying to know is it killing you like its killing me yeah\nI dont know what to say since the twist of fate when it all broke down\nAnd the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now\n\nThis is looking like a contest\nOf who can act like they care less\nBut I liked it better when you were on my side\n\nThe battles in your hands now\nBut I would lay my armour down\nIf you said youd rather love than fight\n\nSo many things that you wish I knew\nBut the story of us might be ending soon\n\nNow Im standing alone in a crowded room and were not speaking\nAnd Im dying to know is it killing you like its killing me yeah\nBut I dont know what to say since the twist of fate when it all broke down\nAnd the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now now now\n\nand were not speaking\nAnd Im dying to know is it killing you like its killing me yeah\nI dont know what to say since the twist of fate cause were going down\nAnd the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now\n\nThe end"}
