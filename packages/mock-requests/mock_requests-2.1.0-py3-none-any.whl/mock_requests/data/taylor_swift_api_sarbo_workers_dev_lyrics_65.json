{"song_id": 65, "song_title": "Forever Winter (Taylor\u2019s version)", "lyrics": "He says he doesnt believe anything much he hears these days\nHe says Why fall in love just so you can watch it go away\nHe spends most of his nights wishing it was how it used to be\nHe spends most of his flights getting pulled down by gravity\nI call just checking up on him\nHes up 3 AM pacing\nHe says Its not just a phase Im in\nMy voice comes out begging\n\nAll this time I didnt know\nYou were breaking down\nId fall to pieces on the floor\nIf you werent around\nToo young to know it gets better\nIll be summer sun for you forever\nForever winter if you go\n\nHe seems fine most of the time\nForcing smiles and never minds\nHis laugh is a symphony\nWhen the lights go out its hard to breathe\nI pull at every thread trying to solve the puzzles in his head\nLive my life scared to death hell decide to leave instead\nI call just checking up on him\nHes up 5 AM wasted\nLong gone not even listening\nMy voice comes out screaming\n\nAll this time I didnt know\nYou were breaking down\nId fall to pieces on the floor\nIf you werent around\nToo young to know it gets better\nIll be summer sun for you forever\nForever winter if you go\n\nIf I was standing there in your apartment\nId take that bomb in your head and disarm it\nId say I love you even at your darkest and\nPlease dont go\n\nI didnt know\nYou were breaking down\nId fall to pieces on the floor\nIf you werent around\nToo young to know it gets better\nIll be summer sun for you forever\nForever winter if you go\n\nIll be your summer sun forever\nAt 3 AM pacing\nAll this time I didnt know\nAt 5 AM wasted\nId be in pieces on the floor\nForever winter if you go\n\nHe says he doesnt believe anything much he hears these days\nI say Believe in one thing I wont go away"}
