{"song_id": 177, "song_title": "You\\'re Losing Me", "lyrics": "You say I dont understand and I say I know you dont\nWe thought a cure would come through in time now I fear it wont\nRemember lookin at this room we loved it cause of the light\nNow I just sit in the dark and wonder if its time\n \nDo I throw out everything we built or keep it\nIm getting tired even for a phoenix\nAlways rising from the ashes\nMendin all her gashes\nYou might just have dealt the final blow\n \nStop youre losing me\nStop youre losing me\nStop youre losing me\nI cant find a pulse\nMy heart wont start anymore for you\nCause youre losing me\n \nEvery mornin I glared at you with storms in my eyes\nHow can you say that you love someone you cant tell is dying\nI sent you signals and bit my nails down to the quick\nMy face was gray but you wouldnt admit that we were sick\n \nAnd the air is thick with loss and indecision\nI know my pain is such an imposition\nNow youre running down the hallway\nAnd you know what they all say\nYou dont know what you got until its gone\n \nStop youre losing me\nStop youre losing me\nStop youre losing me\nI cant find a pulse\nMy heart wont start anymore for you\nCause youre losing me\nCause youre losing me\nStop Stop cause youre losing me\n \nMy heart wont start anymore Stop cause youre losing me\nMy heart wont start anymore Stop cause youre losing me\n \nHow long could we be a sad song\nTill we were too far gone to bring back to life\nI gave you all my best mes my endless empathy\nAnd all I did was bleed as I tried to be the bravest soldier\nFighting in only your army frontlines dont you ignore me\nIm the best thing at this party Youre losing me\nAnd I wouldnt marry me either\nA pathological people pleaser\nWho only wanted you to see her\nAnd Im fading thinking\nDo something baby say something Say something\nLose something baby risk somehing Youre losing me\nChoose something babe I got nothing I got nothing\nTo believe unless youre choosing me\n \nYoure losing me\nStop Stop stop youre losing me\nStop Stop stop youre losing me\nI cant a find pulse my heart wont start anymore"}
