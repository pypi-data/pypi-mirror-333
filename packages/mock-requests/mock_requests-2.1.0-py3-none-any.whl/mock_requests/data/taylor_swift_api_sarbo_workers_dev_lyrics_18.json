{"song_id": 18, "song_title": "The Outside", "lyrics": "I didnt know what I would find\nWhen I went looking for a reason\nI know I didnt read between the lines\nAnd baby Ive got nowhere to go\n\nI tried to take the road less traveled by\nBut nothing seems to work the first few times\nAm I right\n\nSo how can I ever try to be better\nNobody ever lets me in\nI can still see you\nThis aint the best view\nOn the outside looking in\nAnd Ive been a lot of lonely places\nIve never been on the outside\n\nYou saw me there but never knew\nThat I would give it all up to be\nA part of this a part of you\nAnd now its all too late So you see\n\nYou couldve helped if you had wanted to\nBut no one notices until its too late to do anything\n\nSo how can I ever try to be better\nNobody ever lets me in\nI can still see you\nThis aint the best view\nOn the outside looking in\nAnd Ive been a lot of lonely places\nIve never been on the outside\n\nOh yeah\n\nSo how can I ever try to be better\nNobody ever lets me in\nAnd I can still see you\nThis aint the best view\nOn the outside looking in\nAnd Ive been a lot of lonely places\nIve never been on the outside"}
