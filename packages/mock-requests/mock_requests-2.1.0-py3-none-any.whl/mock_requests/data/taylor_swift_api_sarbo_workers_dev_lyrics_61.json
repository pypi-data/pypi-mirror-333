{"song_id": 61, "song_title": "State of Grace (Taylor\u2019s version)", "lyrics": "Im walking fast through the traffic lights\nBusy streets and busy lives\nAnd all we know is touch and go\nWe are alone with our changing minds\nWe fall in love till it hurts or bleeds or fades in time\n\nAnd I never saw you coming\nAnd Ill never be the same\n\nYou come around and the armor falls\nPierce the room like a cannonball\nNow all we know is dont let go\nWe are alone just you and me\nUp in your room and our slates are clean\nJust twin fire signs four blue eyes\n\nSo you were never a saint\nAnd I loved in shades of wrong\nWe learn to live with the pain\nMosaic broken hearts\nBut this love is brave and wild\n\nAnd I never saw you coming\nAnd Ill never be the same\n\nThis is a state of grace\nThis is the worthwhile fight\nLove is a ruthless game\nUnless you play it good and right\nThese are the hands of fate\nYoure my Achilles heel\nThis is the golden age of something good and right and real\n\nAnd I never saw you coming\nAnd Ill never be the same oh\nAnd I never saw you coming\nAnd Ill never be the same\nSo you were never a saint and I loved in shades of wrong\nWe learn to live with the pain mosaic broken hearts\nBut this love is brave and wild\n\nThis is a state of grace\nThis is the worthwhile fight\nLove is a ruthless game\nUnless you play it good and right"}
