{"song_id": 125, "song_title": "My Tears Ricochet", "lyrics": "We gather here\nWe line up weeping in a sunlit room\nAnd if Im on fire\nYoull be made of ashes too\n\nEven on my worst day\nDid I deserve babe\nAll the hell you gave me\nCause I loved you\nI swear I loved you\nTil my dying day\n\nI didnt have it in myself to go with grace\nAnd youre the hero flying around saving face\nAnd if Im dead to you why are you at the wake\nCursing my name\nWishing I stayed\nLook at how my tears ricochet\n\nWe gather stones\nNever knowing what theyll mean\nSome to throw\nSome to make a diamond ring\nYou know I didnt want to\nHave to haunt you\nBut what a ghostly scene\nYou wear the same jewels\nThat I gave you\nAs you bury me\n\nI didnt have it in myself to go with grace\nCause when Id fight you used to tell me I was brave\nAnd if Im dead to you why are you at the wake\nCursing my name\nWishing I stayed\nLook at how my tears ricochet\n\nAnd I can go anywhere I want\nAnywhere I want\nJust not home\nAnd you can aim for my heart go for blood\nBut you would still miss me in your bones\nAnd I still talk to you\nWhen Im screaming at the sky\nAnd when you cant sleep at night\nYou hear my stolen lullabies\n\nI didnt have it in myself to go with grace\nAnd so the battleships will sink beneath the waves\nYou had to kill me but it killed you just the same\nCursing my name\nWishing I stayed\nYou turned into your worst fears\nAnd youre tossing out blame\nDrunk on this pain\nCrossing out the good years\nAnd youre cursing my name\nWishing I stayed\nLook at how my tears ricochet"}
