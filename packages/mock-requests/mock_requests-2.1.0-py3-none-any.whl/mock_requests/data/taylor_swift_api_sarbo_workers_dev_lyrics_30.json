{"song_id": 30, "song_title": "The Best Day", "lyrics": "Im five years old its getting cold Ive got my big coat on\nI hear your laugh and look up smiling at you I run and run\nPast the pumpkin patch and the tractor rides\nLook now the sky is gold\nI hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home\n\nI dont know why all the trees change in the fall\nBut I know youre not scared of anything at all\nDont know if Snow Whites house is near or far away\nBut I know I had the best day with you today\n\nIm thirteen now\nAnd dont know how my friends could be so mean\nI come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys\nAnd we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away\nAnd we talk and window shop til Ive forgotten all their names\n\nI dont know who Im going to talk to now at school\nBut I know Im laughing on the car ride home with you\nDont know how long its going to take to feel okay\nBut I know I had the best day with you today\n\nI have an excellent father his strength is making me stronger\nGod smiles on my little brother inside and out\nHes better than I am\nI grew up in a pretty house and I had space to run\nAnd I had the best days with you\n\nThere is a video I found from back when I was three\nYou set up a paint set in the kitchen and youre talking to me\nIts the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarfs\nAnd Daddys smart\nAnd youre the prettiest lady in the whole wide world\n\nAnd now I know why all the trees change in the fall\nI know you were on my side even when I was wrong\nAnd I love you for giving me your eyes\nFor staying back and watching me shine\nAnd I didnt know if you knew so Im taking this chance to say\nThat I had the best day with you today"}
