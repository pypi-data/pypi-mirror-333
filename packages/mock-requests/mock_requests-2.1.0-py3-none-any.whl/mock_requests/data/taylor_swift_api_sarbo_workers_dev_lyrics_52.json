{"song_id": 52, "song_title": "Never Grow Up", "lyrics": "Your little hands wrapped around my finger\nAnd its so quiet in the world tonight\nYour little eyelids flutter cause youre dreaming\nSo I tuck you in turn on your favorite night light\nTo you everythings funny you got nothing to regret\nId give all I have honey\nIf you could stay like that\n\nOh darling dont you ever grow up\nDont you ever grow up just stay this little\nOh darling dont you ever grow up\nDont you ever grow up it could stay this simple\nI wont let nobody hurt you wont let no one break your heart\nAnd no one will desert you\nJust try to never grow up never grow up\n\nYoure in the car on the way to the movies\nAnd youre mortified your moms dropping you off\nAt fourteen theres just so much you cant do\nAnd you cant wait to move out someday and call your own shots\nBut dont make her drop you off around the block\nRemember that shes getting older too\nAnd dont lose the way that you dance around in your pjs getting ready for school\n\nOh darling dont you ever grow up\nDont you ever grow up just stay this little\nOh darling dont you ever grow up\nDont you ever grow up it could stay this simple\nNo ones ever burned you nothings ever left you scarred\nAnd even though you want to just try to never grow up\n\nTake pictures in your mind of your childhood room\nMemorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home\nRemember the footsteps remember the words said\nAnd all your little brothers favorite songs\nI just realized everything I have is someday gonna be gone\n\nSo here I am in my new apartment\nIn a big city they just dropped me off\nIts so much colder than I thought it would be\nSo I tuck myself in and turn my night light on\n\nWish Id never grown up\nI wish Id never grown up\n\nOh I dont wanna grow up wish Id never grown up\nI could still be little\nOh I dont wanna grow up wish Id never grown up\nIt could still be simple\nOh darling dont you ever grow up\nDont you ever grow up just stay this little\nOh darling dont you ever grow up\nDont you ever grow up it could stay this simple\nWont let nobody hurt you\nWont let no one break your heart\nAnd even though you want to please try to never grow up\nOh dont you ever grow up\nOh never grow up just never grow up"}
