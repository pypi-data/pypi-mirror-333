{"song_id": 141, "song_title": "tolerate it", "lyrics": "I sit and watch you reading with your head low\nI wake and watch you breathing with your eyes closed\nI sit and watch you I notice everything you do or dont do\nYoure so much older and wiser and I\n\nI wait by the door like Im just a kid\nUse my best colors for your portrait\nLay the table with the fancy shit\nAnd watch you tolerate it\nIf its all in my head tell me now\nTell me Ive got it wrong somehow\nI know my love should be celebrated\nBut you tolerate it\n\nI greet you with a battle heros welcome\nI take your indiscretions all in good fun\nI sit and listen I polish plates until they gleam and glisten\nYoure so much older and wiser and I\n\nI wait by the door like Im just a kid\nUse my best colors for your portrait\nLay the table with the fancy shit\nAnd watch you tolerate it\nIf its all in my head tell me now\nTell me Ive got it wrong somehow\nI know my love should be celebrated\nBut you tolerate it\n\nWhile you were out building other worlds where was I\nWheres that man whod throw blankets over my barbed wire\nI made you my temple my mural my sky\nNow Im begging for footnotes in the story of your life\nDrawing hearts in the byline\nAlways taking up too much space or time\nYou assume Im fine\nBut what would you do if I\n\nBreak free and leave us in ruins\nTook this dagger in me and removed it\nGain the weight of you then lose it\nBelieve me I could do it\nIf its all in my head tell me now\nTell me Ive got it wrong somehow\nI know my love should be celebrated\nBut you tolerate it\nI sit and watch you"}
