{"song_id": 108, "song_title": "False God", "lyrics": "We were crazy to think\nCrazy to think that this could work\nRemember how I said Id die for you\nWe were stupid to jump\nIn the ocean separating us\nRemember how Id fly to you\n\nAnd I cant talk to you when youre like this\nStaring out the window like Im not your favorite town\nIm New York City I still do it for you babe\nThey all warned us about times like this\nThey say the road gets hard and you get lost\nWhen youre led by blind faith blind faith\n\nBut we might just get away with it\nReligions in your lips\nEven if its a false god\nWed still worship\nWe might just get away with it\nThe altar is my hips\nEven if its a false god\nWed still worship this love\nWed still worship this love\nWed still worship this love\n\nI know heavens a thing\nI go there when you touch me honey\nHell is when I fight with you\nBut we can patch it up good\nMake confessions and were begging for forgiveness\nGot the wine for you\n\nAnd you cant talk to me when Im like this\nDaring you to leave me just so I can try and scare you\nYoure the West Village\nYou still do it for me babe\nThey all warned us about times like this\nThey say the road gets hard and you get lost\nWhen youre led by blind faith blind faith\n\nBut we might just get away with it\nReligions in your lips\nEven if its a false god\nWed still worship\nWe might just get away with it\nThe altar is my hips\nEven if its a false god\nWed still worship this love\nWed still worship this love\nWed still worship this love ah\n\nStill worship this love\nEven if its a false god\nEven if its a false god\nStill worship this love"}
