{"song_id": 46, "song_title": "Mine", "lyrics": "You were in college working part-time waiting tables\nLeft a small town and never looked back\nI was a flight risk with a fear of falling\nWondering why we bother with love if it never lasts\n\nI say Can you believe it\nAs were lying on the couch\nThe moment I could see it\nYes yes I can see it now\n\nDo you remember we were sitting there by the water\nYou put your arm around me for the first time\nYou made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter\nYou are the best thing thats ever been mine\n\nFlash forward and were taking on the world together\nAnd theres a drawer of my things at your place\nYou learn my secrets and you figure out why Im guarded\nYou say well never make my parents mistakes\n\nBut we got bills to pay\nWe got nothing figured out\nWhen it was hard to take\nYes yes this is what I thought about\n\nDo you remember we were sitting there by the water\nYou put your arm around me for the first time\nYou made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter\nYou are the best thing thats ever been mine\n\nDo you remember all the city lights on the water\nYou saw me start to believe for the first time\nYou made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter\nYou are the best thing thats ever been mine\n\nAnd I remember that fight\nTwo-thirty AM\nAs everything was slipping right out of our hands\nI ran out crying and you followed me out into the street\nBraced myself for the Goodbye\nCause thats all Ive ever known\nThen you took me by surprise\nYou said Ill never leave you alone\n\nYou said I remember how we felt sitting by the water\nAnd every time I look at you its like the first time\nI fell in love with a careless mans careful daughter\nShe is the best thing thats ever been mine\n\nHold on make it last\nHold on never turn back\n\nHold on\nYou made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter\nHold on\nYou are the best thing thats ever been mine\n\nHold on\nYeah yeah\nDo you believe it\nHold on\nWere gonna make it now\nHold on\nAnd I can see it\nYes yes\nI can see it now see it now see it now"}
