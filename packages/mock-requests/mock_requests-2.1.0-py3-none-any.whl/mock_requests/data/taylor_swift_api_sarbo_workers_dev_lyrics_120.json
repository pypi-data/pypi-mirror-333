{"song_id": 120, "song_title": "mad woman", "lyrics": "What did you think Id say to that\nDoes a scorpion sting when fighting back\nThey strike to kill and you know I will\nYou know I will\n\nWhat do you sing on your drive home\nDo you see my face in the neighbors lawn\nDoes she smile\nOr does she mouth Fuck you forever\n\nEvery time you call me crazy\nI get more crazy\nWhat about that\nAnd when you say I seem angry I get more angry\nAnd theres nothing like a mad woman\nWhat a shame she went mad\nNo one likes a mad woman\nYou made her like that\nAnd youll poke that bear til her claws come out\nAnd you find something to wrap your noose around\nAnd theres nothing like a mad woman\n\nNow I breathe flames each time I talk\nMy cannons all firing at your yacht\nThey say move on\nBut you know I wont\nAnd women like hunting witches too\nDoing your dirtiest work for you\nIts obvious that wanting me dead has really brought you two together\n\nEvery time you call me crazy\nI get more crazy\nWhat about that\nAnd when you say I seem angry I get more angry\nAnd theres nothing like a mad woman\nWhat a shame she went mad\nNo one likes a mad woman\nYou made her like that\nAnd youll poke that bear til her claws come out\nAnd you find something to wrap your noose around\nAnd theres nothing like a mad woman\n\nIm taking my time\nTaking my time\nCause you took everything from me\nWatching you climb\nWatching you climb\nOver people like me\nThe master of spin\nHas a couple side flings\nGood wives always know\nShe should be mad\nShould be scathing like me\nBut no one likes a mad woman\nWhat a shame she went mad\n\nYou made her like that"}
