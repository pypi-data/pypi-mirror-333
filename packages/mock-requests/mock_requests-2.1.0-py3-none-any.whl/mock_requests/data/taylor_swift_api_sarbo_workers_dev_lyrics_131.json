{"song_id": 131, "song_title": "illicit affairs", "lyrics": "Make sure nobody sees you leave\nHood over your head\nKeep your eyes down\nTell your friends youre out for a run\nYoull be flushed when you return\nTake the road less traveled by\nTell yourself you can always stop\nWhat started in beautiful rooms\nEnds with meetings in parking lots\n\nAnd thats the thing about illicit affairs\nAnd clandestine meetings\nAnd longing stares\nIts born from just one single glance\nBut it dies and it dies and it dies\na million little times\n\nLeave the perfume on the shelf\nThat you picked out just for him\nSo you leave no trace behind\nLike you dont even exist\nTake the words for what they are\nA dwindling mercurial high\nA drug that only worked\nThe first few hundred times\n\nAnd thats the thing about illicit affairs\nAnd clandestine meetings\nAnd stolen stares\nThey show their truth one single time\nBut they lie and they lie and they lie\na million little times\n\nAnd you wanna scream\nDont call me kid\nDont call me baby\nLook at this godforsaken mess that you made me\nYou showed me colors you know I cant see with anyone else\nDont call me kid\nDont call me baby\nLook at this idiotic fool that you made me\nYou taught me a secret language I cant speak with anyone else\nAnd you know damn well\nFor you I would ruin myself\na million little times"}
