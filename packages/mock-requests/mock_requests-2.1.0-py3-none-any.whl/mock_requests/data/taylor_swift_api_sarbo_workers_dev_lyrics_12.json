{"song_id": 12, "song_title": "New Romantics", "lyrics": "Were all bored were all so tired of everything\nWe wait for trains that just arent coming\nWe show off our different scarlet letters\nTrust me mine is better\n\nWere so young but were on the road to ruin\nWe play dumb but we know exactly what were doing\nWe cry tears of mascara in the bathroom\nHoney life is just a classroom\n\nCause baby I could build a castle\nOut of all the bricks they threw at me\nAnd every day is like a battle\nBut every night with us is like a dream\n\nBaby were the new romantics\nCome on come along with me\nHeartbreak is the national anthem\nWe sing it proudly\nWe are too busy dancing\nTo get knocked off our feet\nBaby were the new romantics\nThe best people in life are free\n\nWere all here the lights and noise are blinding\nWe hang back its all in the timing\nIts poker he cant see it in my face\nBut Im about to play my Ace\n\nWe need love but all we want is danger\nWe team up then switch sides like a record changer\nThe rumors are terrible and cruel\nBut honey most of them are true\n\nCause baby I could build a castle\nOut of all the bricks they threw at me\nAnd every day is like a battle\nBut every night with us is like a dream\n\nBaby were the new romantics\nCome on come along with me\nHeartbreak is the national anthem\nWe sing it proudly\nWe are too busy dancing\nTo get knocked off our feet\nBaby were the new romantics\nThe best people in life are free\n\nSo come on come along with me\nThe best people in life are free\n\nPlease take my hand and\nPlease take me dancing and\nPlease leave me stranded\nIts so romantic its so romantic\nAh ah ah ah ah ah\n\nOh cause baby I could build a castle\nOut of all the bricks they threw at me\nAnd every day is like a battle\nBut every night with us is like a dream\n\nCause baby I could build a castle castle\nOut of all the bricks they threw at me\nAnd every day is like a battle\nBut every night with us is like a dream\n\nBaby were the new romantics\nCome on come along with me\nHeartbreak is the national anthem\nWe sing it proudly\nWe are too busy dancing\nTo get knocked off our feet\nBaby were the new romantics\nThe best people in life are free"}
