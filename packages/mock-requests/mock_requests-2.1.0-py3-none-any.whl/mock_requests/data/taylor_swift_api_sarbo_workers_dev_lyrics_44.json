{"song_id": 44, "song_title": "Enchanted", "lyrics": "There I was again tonight\nForcing laughter faking smiles\nSame old tired lonely place\n\nWalls of insincerity\nShifting eyes and vacancy\nVanished when I saw your face\n\nAll I can say is it was enchanting to meet you\n\nYour eyes whispered Have we met\nAcross the room your silhouette\nStarts to make its way to me\nThe playful conversation starts\nCounter all your quick remarks\nLike passing notes in secrecy\n\nAnd it was enchanting to meet you\nAll I can say is I was enchanted to meet you\n\nThis night is sparkling dont you let it go\nIm wonderstruck blushing all the way home\nIll spend forever wondering if you knew\nI was enchanted to meet you\n\nThe lingering question kept me up\n2 AM who do you love\nI wonder til Im wide awake\nAnd now Im pacing back and forth\nWishing you were at my door\nId open up and you would say Hey\nIt was enchanting to meet you\nAll I know is I was enchanted to meet you\n\nThis night is sparkling dont you let it go\nIm wonderstruck blushing all the way home\nIll spend forever wondering if you knew\nThis night is flawless dont you let it go\nIm wonderstruck dancing around all alone\nIll spend forever wondering if you knew\nI was enchanted to meet you\n\nThis is me praying that\nThis was the very first page\nNot where the story line ends\nMy thoughts will echo your name\nUntil I see you again\nThese are the words I held back\nAs I was leaving too soon\nI was enchanted to meet you\n\nPlease dont be in love with someone else\nPlease dont have somebody waiting on you\nPlease dont be in love with someone else\nPlease dont have somebody waiting on you\n\nThis night is sparkling dont you let it go\nIm wonderstruck blushing all the way home\nIll spend forever wondering if you knew\nThis night is flawless dont you let it go\nPlease dont be in love with someone else\nIm wonderstruck dancing around all alone\nPlease dont have somebody waiting on you\nIll spend forever wondering if you knew\nPlease dont be in love with someone else\nI was enchanted to meet you\n\nPlease dont be in love with someone else\nPlease dont have somebody waiting on you"}
