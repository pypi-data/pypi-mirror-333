{"song_id": 151, "song_title": "Mastermind", "lyrics": "Once upon a time the planets and the fates and all the stars aligned\nYou and I ended up in the same room at the same time\nAnd the touch of a hand lit the fuse\nOf a chain reaction of countermoves\nTo assess the equation of you\nCheckmate I couldnt lose\n\nWhat if I told you none of it was accidental\nAnd the first night that you saw me nothing was gonna stop me\nI laid the groundwork and then just like clockwork\nThe dominoes cascaded in a line\nWhat if I told you Im a mastermind\nAnd now youre mine\nIt was all by design\nCause Im a mastermind\n\nYou see all the wisest women had to do it this way\nCause we were born to be the pawn in every lovers game\nIf you fail to plan you plan to fail\nStrategy sets the scene for the tale\nIm the wind in our free-flowing sails\nAnd the liquor in our cocktails\n\nWhat if I told you none of it was accidental\nAnd the first night that you saw me I knew I wanted your body\nI laid the groundwork and then just like clockwork\nThe dominoes cascaded in a line\nWhat if I told you Im a mastermind\nAnd now youre mine\nIt was all my design\nCause Im a mastermind\n\nNo one wanted to play with me as a little kid\nSo Ive been scheming like a criminal ever since\nTo make them love me and make it seem effortless\nThis is the first time Ive felt the need to confess\nAnd I swear\nIm only cryptic and Machiavellian cause I care\n\nSo I told you none of it was accidental\nAnd the first night that you saw me nothing was gonna stop me\nI laid the groundwork and then saw a wide smirk\nOn your face you knew the entire time\nYou knew that Im a mastermind\nAnd now youre mine\nYeah all you did was smile\nCause Im a mastermind"}
