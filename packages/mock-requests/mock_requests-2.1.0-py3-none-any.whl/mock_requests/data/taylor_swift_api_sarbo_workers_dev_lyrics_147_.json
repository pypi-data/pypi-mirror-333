{"song_id": 147, "song_title": "Snow on the Beach", "lyrics": "One night a few moons ago\nI saw flecks of what couldve been lights\nBut it might just have been you\nPassing by unbeknownst to me\nLife is emotionally abusive\nAnd time cant stop me quite like you did\nAnd my flight was awful thanks for asking\nIm unglued thanks to you\n\nAnd its like snow at the beach\nWeird but fuckin beautiful\nFlying in a dream\nStars by the pocketful\nYou wanting me tonight feels impossible\nBut its comin down no sound its all around\nLike snow on the beach\n\nLike snow on the beach\nLike snow on the beach\nLike snow oh\n\nThis scene feels like what I once saw on a screen\nI searched aurora borealis green\nIve never seen someone lit from within\nBlurring out my periphery\nMy smile is like I won a contest\nAnd to hide that would be so dishonest\nAnd its fine to fake it till you make it\nTill you do\nTill its true\n\nNow its like snow at the beach\nWeird but fuckin beautiful\nFlying in a dream\nStars by the pocketful\nYou wanting me tonight feels impossible\nBut its comin down no sound its all around\nLike snow on the beach\n\nLike snow on the beach\nLike snow on the beach\nLike snow oh\n\nI cant speak afraid to jinx it\nI dont even dare to wish it\nBut your eyes are flying saucers from another planet\nNow Im all for you like Janet\nCan this be a real thing can it\n\nAre we falling like\nSnow at the beach\nWeird but fuckin beautiful\nFlying in a dream\nStars by the pocketful\nYou wanting me tonight feels impossible\nBut its comin down no sound its all around\nLike snow on the beach\nLike snow on the beach\nLike snow on the beach\nLike snow\nBut its comin down no sound its all around\n\nLike snow on the beach\nIts coming down its coming down its coming down its coming down\nLike snow on the beach\nIts coming down its coming down its coming down its coming down\nIts coming down its coming down its coming down its coming down\nDown its coming down its coming down its coming down"}
