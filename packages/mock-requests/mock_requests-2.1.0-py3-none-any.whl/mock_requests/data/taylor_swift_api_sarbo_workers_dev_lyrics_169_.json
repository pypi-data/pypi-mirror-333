{"song_id": 169, "song_title": "the lakes", "lyrics": "Is it romantic how all my elegies eulogize me\nIm not cut out for all these cynical clones\nThese hunters with cell phones\n\nTake me to the Lakes where all the poets went to die\nI dont belong and my beloved neither do you\nThose Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry\nIm setting off but not without my muse\n\nWhat should be over burrowed under my skin\nIn heart-stopping waves of hurt\nIve come too far to watch some namedropping sleaze\nTell me what are my words worth\n\nTake me to the Lakes where all the poets went to die\nI dont belong and my beloved neither do you\nThose Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry\nIm setting off but not without my muse\n\nI want auroras and sad prose\nI want to watch wisteria grow right over my bare feet\nCause I havent moved in years\nAnd I want you right here\nA red rose grew up out of ice frozen ground\nWith no one around to tweet it\nWhile I bathe in cliffside pools\nWith my calamitous love and insurmountable grief\n\nTake me to the Lakes where all the poets went to die\nI dont belong and my beloved neither do you\nThose Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry\nIm setting off but not without my muse\nNo not without you"}
