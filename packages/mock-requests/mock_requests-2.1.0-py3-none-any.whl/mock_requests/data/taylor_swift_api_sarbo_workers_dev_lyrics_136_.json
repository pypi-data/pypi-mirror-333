{"song_id": 136, "song_title": "cowboy like me", "lyrics": "And the tennis court was covered up\nWith some tent-like thing\nAnd you asked me to dance\nBut I said Dancin is a dangerous game\n\nOh I thought\nThis is gonna be one of those things\nNow I know\nIm never gonna love again\n\nIve got some tricks up my sleeve\nTakes one to know one\nYoure a cowboy like me\n\nNever wanted love\nJust a fancy car\nNow Im waiting by the phone\nLike Im sitting in an airport bar\n\nYou had some tricks up your sleeve\nTakes one to know one\nYoure a cowboy like me\n\nPerched in the dark\nTelling all the rich folks anything they wanna hear\nLike it could be love\nI could be the way forward\nOnly if they pay for it\nYoure a bandit like me\nEyes full of stars\nHustling for the good life\nNever thought Id meet you here\nIt could be love\nWe could be the way forward\nAnd I know Ill pay for it\n\nYoure a cowboy like me\n\nPerched in the dark\nTelling all the rich folks anything they wanna hear\nLike it could be love\nI could be the way forward\nOnly if they pay for it\nYoure a bandit like me\nEyes full of stars\nHustling for the good life\nNever thought Id meet you here\nIt could be love\nWe could be the way forward\nAnd I know Ill pay for it\n\nAnd the skeletons in both our closets\nPlotted hard to fuck this up\nAnd the old men that Ive swindled\nReally did believe I was the one\nAnd the ladies lunching have their stories about\nWhen you passed through town\nBut that was all before I locked it down\n\nNow you hang from my lips\nLike the Gardens of Babylon\nWith your boots beneath my bed\nForever is the sweetest con\n\nIve had some tricks up my sleeve\nTakes one to know one\nYoure a cowboy like me\nAnd Im never gonna love again\nIm never gonna love again\nIm never gonna love again"}
