{"song_id": 43, "song_title": "Back To December", "lyrics": "Im so glad you made time to see me\nHows life Tell me hows your family\nI havent seen them in a while\n\nYouve been good busier than ever\nWe small-talk work and the weather\nYour guard is up and I know why\n\nBecause the last time you saw me is still burned in the back of your mind\nYou gave me roses and I left them there to die\n\nSo this is me swallowing my pride\nStanding in front of you saying Im sorry for that night\nAnd I go back to December all the time\n\nIt turns out freedom aint nothing but missing you\nWishing Id realized what I had when you were mine\nId go back to December turn around and make it all right\nI go back to December all the time\n\nThese days I havent been sleeping\nStaying up playing back myself leaving\nWhen your birthday passed and I didnt call\n\nAnd I think about summer all the beautiful times\nI watched you laughing from the passenger side\nAnd realized I loved you in the fall\n\nAnd then the cold came the dark days when fear crept into my mind\nYou gave me all your love and all I gave you was Goodbye\n\nSo this is me swallowing my pride\nStanding in front of you saying Im sorry for that night\nAnd I go back to December all the time\n\nIt turns out freedom aint nothing but missing you\nWishing Id realized what I had when you were mine\nId go back to December turn around and change my own mind\nI go back to December all the time\n\nI miss your tanned skin your sweet smile\nSo good to me so right\nAnd how you held me in your arms that September night\nThe first time you ever saw me cry\n\nMaybe this is wishful thinking\nProbably mindless dreaming\nBut if we loved again I swear Id love you right\n\nId go back in time and change it but I cant\nSo if the chain is on your door I understand\n\nBut this is me swallowing my pride\nStanding in front of you saying Im sorry for that night\nAnd I go back to December\n\nIt turns out freedom aint nothing but missing you\nWishing Id realized what I had when you were mine\nId go back to December turn around and make it all right\nId go back to December turn around and change my own mind\n\nI go back to December all the time\nAll the time"}
