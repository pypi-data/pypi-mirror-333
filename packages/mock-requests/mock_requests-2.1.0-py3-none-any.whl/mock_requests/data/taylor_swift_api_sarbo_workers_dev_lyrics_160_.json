{"song_id": 160, "song_title": "The Great War", "lyrics": "My knuckles were bruised like violets\nSucker punching walls\nCursed you as I sleep talked\nSpineless in my tomb of silence\nTore your banners down\nTook the battle underground\nAnd maybe it was egos swinging\nMaybe it was her\nFlashes of the battle come back to me in a blur\n\nAll that bloodshed crimson clover\nUh-huh sweet dream was over\nMy hand was the one you reached for\nAll throughout the Great War\nAlways remember uh-huh\nTears on the letter I vowed\nNot to cry anymore\nIf we survived the Great War\n\nYou drew up some good faith treaties\nI drew curtains closed\nDrank my poison all alone\nYou said I have to trust more freely\nBut diesel is desire\nYou were playing with fire\nAnd maybe its the past thats talking\nScreaming from the crypt\nTelling me to punish you for things you never did\nSo I justified it\n\nAll that bloodshed crimson clover\nUh-huh the bombs were closer\nMy hand was the one you reached for\nAll throughout the Great War\nAlways remember uh-huh\nThe burning embers I vowed\nNot to fight anymore\nIf we survived the Great War\nUh-huh uh-huh\n\nIt turned into something bigger\nSomewhere in the haze\nGot a sense Id been betrayed\nYour finger on my hairpin triggers\nSoldier down on that icy ground\nLooked up at me with honor and truth\nBroken and blue\nSo I called off the troops\nThat was the night I nearly lost you\nI really thought Id lost you\n\nWe can plant a memory garden\nSay a solemn prayer\nPlace a poppy in my hair\nTheres no morning glory\nIt was war it wasnt fair\nAnd we will never go back to that\n\nBloodshed crimson clover\nUh-huh the worst was over\nMy hand was the one you reached for\nAll throughout the Great War\nAlways remember uh-huh\nWere burned for better I vowed\nI would always be yours\nCause we survived the Great War\nUh-huh uh-huh\nI will always be yours\nCause we survived the Great War\nUh-huh\nI vowed I will always be yours"}
