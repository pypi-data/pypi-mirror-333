{"song_id": 157, "song_title": "Anti-Hero", "lyrics": "I have this thing where I get older but just never wiser\nMidnights become my afternoons\nWhen my depression works the graveyard shift all of the people\nIve ghosted stand there in the room\n\nI should not be left to my own devices\nThey come with prices and vices\nI end up in crisis\nTale as old as time\nI wake up screaming from dreaming\nOne day Ill watch as youre leaving\nCause you got tired of my scheming\nFor the last time\n\nIts me hi Im the problem its me\nAt teatime everybody agrees\nIll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror\nIt must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero\n\nSometimes I feel like everybody is a sexy baby\nAnd Im a monster on the hill\nToo big to hang out slowly lurching toward your favorite city\nPierced through the heart but never killed\n\nDid you hear my covert narcissism\nI disguise as altruism\nLike some kind of congressman\nA tale as old as time\nI wake up screaming from dreaming\nOne day Ill watch as youre leaving\nAnd life will lose all its meaning\nFor the last time\n\nIts me hi Im the problem its me Im the problem its me\nAt teatime everybody agrees\nIll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror\nIt must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero\n\nI have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money\nShe thinks I left them in the will\nThe family gathers round and reads it and then someone screams out\nShes laughing up at us from Hell\n\nIts me hi\nIm the problem its me\nIts me hi\nIm the problem its me\nIts me hi\nEverybody agrees everybody agrees\n\nIts me hi Hi Im the problem its me Im the problem its me\nAt teatime Teatime everybody agrees Everybody agrees\nIll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror\nIt must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero"}
