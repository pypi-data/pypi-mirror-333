{"song_id": 37, "song_title": "The Way I Loved You", "lyrics": "He is sensible and so incredible\nAnd all my single friends are jealous\nHe says everything I need to hear and its like\nI couldnt ask for anything better\nHe opens up my door and I get into his car\nAnd he says you look beautiful tonight\nAnd I feel perfectly fine\n\nBut I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain\nAnd its 2 AM and Im cursing your name\nYoure so in love that you act insane\nAnd thats the way I loved you\nBreaking down and coming undone\nIts a roller coaster kind of rush\nAnd I never knew I could feel that much\nAnd thats the way I loved you\n\nHe respects my space\nAnd never makes me wait\nAnd he calls exactly when he says he will\nHes close to my mother\nTalks business with my father\nHes charming and endearing\nAnd Im comfortable\n\nBut I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain\nIts 2 AM and Im cursing your name\nYoure so in love that you acted insane\nAnd thats the way I loved you\nBreaking down and coming undone\nIts a roller coaster kind of rush\nAnd I never knew I could feel that much\nAnd thats the way I loved you\n\nHe cant see the smile Im faking\nAnd my hearts not breaking\nCause Im not feeling anything at all\nAnd you were wild and crazy\nJust so frustrating\nIntoxicating complicated\nGot away by some mistake and now\n\nI miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain\nIts 2 AM and Im cursing your name\nIm so in love that I acted insane\nAnd thats the way I loved you\nBreaking down and coming undone\nIts a roller coaster kind of rush\nAnd I never knew I could feel that much\nAnd thats the way I loved you oh oh\n\nAnd thats the way I loved you oh oh\nNever knew I could feel that much\nAnd thats the way I loved you"}
