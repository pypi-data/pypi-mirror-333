{"song_id": 168, "song_title": "it\\'s time to go", "lyrics": "When the dinner is cold and the chatter gets old\nYou ask for the tab\nOr that moment again hes insisting that friends\nLook at each other like that\nWhen the words of a sister come back in whispers\nThat prove she was not\nIn fact what she seemed not a twin from your dreams\nShes a crook who was caught\n\nThat old familiar body ache\nThe snaps from the same little breaks in your soul\nYou know when its time to go\n\nTwenty years at your job\nThen the son of the boss gets the spot that was yours\nOr trying to stay for the kids\nWhen keeping it how it is will only break their hearts worse\n\nThat old familiar body ache\nThe snaps from the same little breaks in your soul\nYou know when its time to go\n\nSometimes giving up is the strong thing\nSometimes to run is the brave thing\nSometimes walking out is the one thing\nThat will find you the right thing\nSometimes giving up is the strong thing\nSometimes to run is the brave thing\nSometimes walking out is the one thing\nThat will find you the right thing\n\nFifteen years fifteen million tears\nBegging til my knees bled\nI gave it my all he gave me nothing at all\nThen wondered why I left\nNow he sits on his throne in his palace of bones\nPraying to his greed\nHes got my past frozen behind glass\nBut Ive got me\n\nThat old familiar body ache\nThe snaps from the same little breaks in my soul\nI know when its time to go\n\nSometimes giving up is the strong thing\nSometimes to run is the brave thing\nSometimes walking out is the one thing\nThat will find you the right thing\nSometimes giving up is the strong thing\nSometimes to run is the brave thing\nSometimes walking out is the one thing\nThat will find you the right thing\nThat will find you the right thing\nAnd you know in your soul\nYou know in your soul\nWhen its time to go\nYou know you know you know you know\nWhen its time to go\nSo then you go\nThen you go\nYou just go"}
