Installation

Stable release
--------------

To install :mod:`unyt`, run this command in your terminal:

.. code-block:: console

    $ python -m pip install unyt

If you have a C compiler available, we also suggest installing `fastcache`_,
which will improve the performance of `SymPy`_.

If you don't have `pip`_ installed, this `Python installation guide`_ can guide
you through the process.

If you use `conda`_, :mod:`unyt` is available via `conda-forge`_:

.. code-block:: console

   $ conda install -c conda-forge unyt

It is not necessary to explicitly install ``fastcache`` if you use ``conda``
because it will be installed automatically as a dependency of ``SymPy``.

From source
-----------

The sources for :mod:`unyt` can be downloaded from the `Github repo`_.

If you don't need an editable install, the following line is all you need to run

.. code-block:: console

    $ python -m pip install git+https//github.com/yt-project/unyt.git

If you would like to make an "editable" where you can directly edit the
Python source files of the installed version of ``unyt``, then you can download
the latest version from Github either with ``git``

.. code-block:: console

    $ git clone git://github.com/yt-project/unyt

or download the `tarball`_:

.. code-block:: console

    $ curl -OL https://github.com/yt-project/unyt/tarball/main

Once you have a copy of the source, you can install it by navigating to the root of the installation and issuing the following command:

.. code-block:: console

    $ python -m pip install -e .

.. _Github repo: https://github.com/yt-project/unyt
.. _tarball: https://github.com/yt-project/unyt/tarball/main

Running the tests
-----------------

You can check that :mod:`unyt` is working properly by running the unit tests
on your installed copy:

.. doctest::

  >>> import unyt
  >>> unyt.test()  # doctest: +SKIP

Note that you'll need ``pytest`` installed for this function to run.
