# Absurd Errors Module

## What is this?
This module defines a collection of absurdly specific and completely unnecessary errors! Perfect for blaming the user, the author, the code, your machine, or even the laws of logic itself.

Use at your own risk. Please. For the love of God.

## Why does this exist?
Because sometimes, standard exceptions like `ValueError` or `RuntimeError` just donâ€™t cut it. Sometimes, you need to express just how screwed up things are with more *precision*.

## Installation
No need to installâ€”just copy-paste it into your project and enjoy the chaos.

## Usage
Raise these errors when you need to make a point, confuse a junior developer, or just vent your frustration in a productive way:

```python
from absurd_errors import *

# Blame the user
raise UserIsAnIdiotError("PEBKAC confirmed.")

# Blame the developer
raise ForgotToImplementError("You had one job.")

# Blame the code
raise CodeIsFuckedUpError("Congratulations, you broke it.")

# Blame reality
raise ParadoxError("This should not be happening. Yet, here we are.")
```

## Error Categories

- **User Errors** â€“ Because sometimes the problem *is* between the keyboard and the chair.
- **Developer Errors** â€“ When the author is the real problem.
- **Code Errors** â€“ If your spaghetti code finally collapses.
- **Hardware Errors** â€“ The computer *swears* itâ€™s not its fault.
- **Logic Errors** â€“ When logic decides to take a vacation.
- **Miscellaneous WTF Errors** â€“ For when you truly have no idea whatâ€™s happening.
