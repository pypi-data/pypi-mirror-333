## Get Started

1. **Installation:**

   ```bash
   pip install locallab
   ```

2. **Using the CLI (New!):**

   ```bash
   # Start the server with interactive configuration
   locallab start

   # Start with specific options
   locallab start --model microsoft/phi-2 --quantize --quantize-type int8

   # Run the configuration wizard without starting the server
   locallab config

   # Display system information
   locallab info
   ```

3. **Starting the Server Programmatically:**

   ```python
   from locallab import start_server
   start_server()
   ```

4. **Starting the Server on Google Colab:**

   ```python
   !pip install locallab

   # Set up your ngrok auth token (REQUIRED for public access)
   # Get your free token from: https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken
   import os
   os.environ["NGROK_AUTH_TOKEN"] = "your_token_here"

   # Optional: Configure model and optimizations
   os.environ["HUGGINGFACE_MODEL"] = "microsoft/phi-2"  # Choose your preferred model
   os.environ["LOCALLAB_ENABLE_QUANTIZATION"] = "true"  # Enable model optimizations

   # Start the server with ngrok for public access
   from locallab import start_server
   start_server(use_ngrok=True)  # Creates a public URL accessible from anywhere
   ```

5. **Connecting your Client:**

   ```python
   from locallab.client import LocalLabClient

   # Use the ngrok URL displayed in the output above
   client = LocalLabClient("https://xxxx-xxx-xxx-xxx.ngrok.io")

   # Test the connection
   response = client.generate("Hello, how are you?")
   print(response)
   ```

## CLI Features (New in v0.4.8!)

LocalLab now includes a powerful command-line interface with the following features:

- **Interactive Configuration:** Guided setup for all server settings
- **Environment Detection:** Smart defaults based on your system
- **Persistent Settings:** Configuration stored in `~/.locallab/config.json`
- **System Information:** Detailed insights about your hardware
- **Performance Optimizations:** Easy configuration of quantization and other optimizations
- **Google Colab Integration:** Automatic detection and configuration for Colab environments

Example CLI usage:

```bash
# Start with interactive prompts
locallab start

# Configure with specific options
locallab start --model microsoft/phi-2 --port 8080 --quantize --attention-slicing

# Run configuration wizard
locallab config

# Check system resources
locallab info
```
