### gitignore-gen ðŸš€

A powerful command-line tool to generate .gitignore files for your projects with ease.

### Problem It Solves


Managing project files effectively is crucial for clean and efficient development. Without proper .gitignore files, repositories become cluttered with:
- Build artifacts and compiled code that should be generated locally

- Dependency directories that bloat repository size (like node_modules)

- Environment-specific configuration files with sensitive information

- IDE and editor-specific files that cause conflicts between team members

- Temporary and cache files that serve no purpose in version control

Creating these files manually is time-consuming and error-prone, often leading to:

- Accidental commits of sensitive or unnecessary files

- Repository bloat that slows down cloning and fetching

- Merge conflicts in files that shouldn't be tracked

- Inconsistent ignore patterns across different projects

### Credibility

Currently there are many tools that provide this gitignore file to you but those are web based so you need to copy and paste it again again when you create a new project but in our case you can get the full gitignore with simply by typing one command in your terminal and it will automatically save it to your project directory with caching mechanism implemented. **NO TYPING MISTAKE OR NO COPY PASTE SIMPLY ONE COMMAND --> "gitignore-gen"**
