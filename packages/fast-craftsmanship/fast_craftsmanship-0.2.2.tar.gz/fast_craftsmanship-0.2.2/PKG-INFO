# Fast-Craftsmanship CLI Tool

Fast-Craftsmanship is a CLI tool designed to streamline the management and scaffolding of FastAPI projects. It follows best practices to help you create a clean, consistent, and scalable project structure, whether you are starting a new project or adding features to an existing one.

📚 **Documentation**: [https://fguedes90.github.io/fast-craftsmanship/](https://fguedes90.github.io/fast-craftsmanship/)

## Features

- **Project Initialization**: Quickly scaffold a new FastAPI project with a pre-defined structure.
- **DDD Structure Generation**: Generate files for domain, service, API, repository, and tests following Domain-Driven Design principles.
- **Database Migrations**: Easily create, apply, and rollback database migrations.
- **Code Verification**: Run type checking, linting, tests, and formatting checks using a single command.
- **Extensibility**: Easily extend the CLI with custom templates and commands.

## Releasing New Versions

This project uses GitHub Actions for CI/CD with semantic versioning:

1. To create a new release, go to the GitHub Actions tab and run the "Bump Version" workflow
2. Choose the version type (patch, minor, or major)
3. The workflow will:
   - Update the version in pyproject.toml
   - Commit and push the changes
   - Create a tag for the new version
   - Trigger the release workflow
