    """Create a shell command task.

    This is the first type of task that we support, and more types
    will likely follow.  A shell command will evaluate an arbitrary
    command on the cluster - it does not even need to be written in
    Python! However, if you are using the `pip` environment engine
    then it will need to be `pip`-installable.

    The interface here is somewhat subject to change, but we think the
    basics here are reasonable.

    Args:
        cmd: The command to execute, as a list of strings

        environment: The name of the environment to evaluate the
            command in.  The default (`None`) will select `default` if
            available, falling back on `empty`.

        envvars: A dictionary of environment variables to set before
            the task runs.  Do not set `PATH` in here, it will not
            currently have an effect.

        driver: The driver to launch the task with.  Generally this is
            not needed as we expect most people to have a single
            driver set.

        root: The root, or if not given search from the current directory.

    Returns:
        The newly-created task identifier, a 32-character hex string.
