## Best Practices

When applying Mantis AI to your own use cases, consider these best practices:

### Crafting Effective Extraction Prompts

The quality of your extraction results depends heavily on the prompts you provide. Here are some tips:

- **Be specific**: Clearly define what information you want to extract
- **Provide context**: Include relevant background information in your prompt
- **Use examples**: For complex extractions, include examples of the desired output format
- **Break down complex tasks**: For multi-part extractions, consider making multiple calls with focused prompts

### Processing Large Audio Files

For long audio files (over 30 minutes), consider:

- Breaking the file into smaller segments for processing
- Using a more focused approach with extraction to target specific information
- Implementing progress tracking for better user experience

### Handling Multiple Files

When processing multiple files:

- Use asynchronous processing when possible
- Implement error handling to continue processing even if some files fail
- Consider batching files for more efficient processing
