# CrossConfig

This package provides a simple cross-platform configuration system for storing,
loading, and updating settings for an application or project. This package uses
only standard library modules, and it encodes settings in JSON.

## Installation

```bash
pip install crossconfig
```

## Status

Issues can be tracked [here](https://github.com/k98kurz/crossconfig/issues).
Changelog can be found
[here](https://github.com/k98kurz/crossconfig/blob/master/changelog.md)

## Usage

Usage is simple: import the `get_config` function, and call it with the name of
your application. This will return a config object that you can use to load,
save, and get settings. If you want to use a portable config, pass
`portable=True` to the function, and the settings file will be stored in the
current working directory instead of the user's home directory.

Full documentation generated by [autodox](https://pypi.org/project/autodox) can
be found [here](https://github.com/k98kurz/crossconfig/blob/master/docs.md).

<summary>Example</summary>

```python
from crossconfig import get_config

# choose whether to load the config for the current user or a portable config
portable = True

# load the config
config = get_config("my_app_name", portable=portable)
config.load()

# get a path for a subdirectory
subdir_path = config.path("subdir")

# set a setting
config.set("my_setting", "my_value")

# save and reload the config
config.save()
[config.unset(key) for key in config.list()]
assert len(config.list()) == 0
config.load()

# get a setting
assert config.get("my_setting") == "my_value"

# unset a setting
config.unset("my_setting")

# save the config
config.save()
```
</details>

### Notes

- The `load` method will return a JSON decode error if the config file is not
  valid JSON. If it loads successfully, it will return `None`.
- There is no lock for multi-threaded access to the config object or file.
  calling `save` or `load` in a multi-threaded environment may result in a race
  condition.
- If a setting is set in one instance of the config object, it will be
  reflected in all other instances of the config object retrieved with the same
  call to `get_config` within the same process.
- This may not follow the Windows- or MacOS-specific conventions for the current
  year. The goal is to make something that works regardless. However, if the
  behavior of `os.expanduser` or `os.getcwd` changes, this may break in the
  future.

## Testing

To test, clone the repo and then execute the test files.

On Windows:

```cmd
python tests\test_base.py
python tests\test_windows.py
```

On civilized OSes:

```bash
find tests/ -name test_*.py -print -exec python {} \;
```

Testing suites are platform-specific, but the tests that should not run on a
given platform will be skipped if their files are run.

There are a total of 11 tests: 1 test of the base class functions; 5 tests for
POSIX systems; and 5 tests for Windows.
