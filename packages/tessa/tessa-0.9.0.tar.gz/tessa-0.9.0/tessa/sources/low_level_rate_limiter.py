"""Rate Limiter -- makes sure we don't hit the APIs too often by waiting by default and
waiting exponentially if a 429 error is encountered.

The goal is to never run into errors in the first place, because some sites like
coingecko.com take substantial time until they allow-list a blocked IP address again.
That is also why we can't use a library such das Tenacity here.

Note that this module is no longer used by the package. But I left it in here anyway,
because it might come in handy for people who use the pycoingecko or some other library
in other ways than through this package.

Usage: Import the module and call `setup_guards()`.
