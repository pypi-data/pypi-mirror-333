# üß† SuperForecast Client  

**A modern forecasting API client powered by bio-inspired AI models.**  

## üìå Overview  

AI Forecast Client is a powerful Python package that enables users to interact with an advanced forecasting API. The underlying AI models are inspired by the way the human brain processes information, leveraging neural dynamics to achieve high-accuracy predictions with adaptive learning capabilities.  

## üöÄ Features  

- **Bio-inspired AI Models** ‚Äì Forecasting algorithms based on human brain mechanisms.  
- **Historical Data Utilization** ‚Äì Incorporates past trends for robust future predictions.  
- **Configurable Forecasting Methods** ‚Äì Choose from multiple forecasting strategies.  
- **Segmented Predictions** ‚Äì Supports advanced fragments-based forecasting.  
- **Flexible API Integration** ‚Äì Simple and efficient API request handling.  

## üì¶ Installation  

Install via `pip`:  

```bash
pip install superforecast
```

## üîß Usage  

```python
from superforecast import SuperForecast

# Initialize the client
sp = SuperForecast()

# Request a forecast
forecast = sp.forecast(
    history=[...],  # Your time-series data
    generalization=1,
    steps=10
)

print(forecast)
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è API Parameters  

| Parameter       | Description                                              | Default | Max (Free Version) |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------------------|
| `history`      | Time-series historical data for training                 | N/A     | 360                |
| `generalization` | Generalization level for the forecast                 | 1       | -                  |
| `steps`        | Number of forecast steps                                 | 10      | 10                 |
| `ret_all_series` | Return all series or only forecasted steps            | True    | -                  |
| `ysmooth`      | Apply smoothing to forecast values                       | False   | -                  |
| `method`       | Forecasting method (1 to 7)                              | 1~7       |                  |
| `segments`     | Number of fragments in the forecast                      | 50      | 50                 |

## üì° API Response  

A typical API response returns a dictionary with predicted values:

```json
{
    "forecast": [123.4, 125.6, 127.8, ...],
    "confidence_intervals": [[120.1, 126.7], [123.5, 129.3], ...]
}
```
