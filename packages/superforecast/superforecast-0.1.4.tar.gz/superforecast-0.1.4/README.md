The underlying AI models are inspired by the way the human brain processes information, leveraging neural dynamics to achieve high-accuracy predictions with adaptive learning capabilities.  

## 🚀 Features  

- **Bio-inspired AI Models** – Forecasting algorithms based on human brain mechanisms.  
- **Historical Data Utilization** – Incorporates past trends for robust future predictions.  
- **Configurable Forecasting Methods** – Choose from multiple forecasting strategies.  
- **Segmented Predictions** – Supports advanced fragments-based forecasting.  
- **Flexible API Integration** – Simple and efficient API request handling.  

## 📦 Installation  

Install via `pip`:  

```bash
pip install superforecast
```

## 🔧 Usage  

```python
from superforecast import SuperForecast

# Initialize the client
sp = SuperForecast()

# Request a forecast
forecast = sp.forecast(
    history=[...],  # Your time-series data
    generalization=1,
    steps=10
)

print(forecast)
```
