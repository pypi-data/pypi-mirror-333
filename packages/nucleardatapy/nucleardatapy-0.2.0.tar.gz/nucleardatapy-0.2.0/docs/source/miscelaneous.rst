Contributing
------------

For the moment, contributions are based on co-optation among the team.

To make contribution easy, we all work in the `main` branch and we shall therefore remember to pull before working and pulling after, with a running version. For long developments, you can work in a local folder (in `mylib` for instance) and copy your contribution to the GitHub folder once you are sure it is functionning. So the final step should last less than 5 minutes, and can be safely done between a pull and before a push. Since we are not numerous, we hope that no one will work in the same part of the code at the same time (i.e. between a pull and a push). It is probably the simpler way to proceed.

Once the toolkit is released, the rules to contribute will be changing. A team of developpers should be defined and a generic email to contact them should be created. Here is a suggestion to contribute after the release.

This file describes how new contributors to the project can start contributing.

**Two ways:**

You can provide your data and interacting with one of our developer.

You can also join the developing team and extend the functionality of this toolkit.

**Provide your data:**

Please contact the developer team directly by shooting an email to TBC.

Then you can interact directly with one of our developer and provide your data. You will not be able to push your data to the repository, but an updated version of the toolkit will contain your new data.

**Join the team:**

Please contact the developer team directly by shooting an email to TBC. Explain the reason why you wish to join the team and if you have ideas about extending the functionality of the toolkit. 

Once in the team, a branch will be dedicated to your contribution. You could show it during our virtual meetings, and your contribution will be merged to the new version of the toolkit.

Report issues
-------------

For the current version, we report issues chatting among us. 
Once this toolkit is released, we should setup a way that users could contact us and report issues or difficulties in installing or using the toolkit.
