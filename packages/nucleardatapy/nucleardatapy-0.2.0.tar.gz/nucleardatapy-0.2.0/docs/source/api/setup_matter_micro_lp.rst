Here are a set of figures which are produced with the Python sample: /nucleardatapy_sample/plots/plot_matter_setupMicroLP.py

.. figure:: ../../../version-0.2/nucleardatapy_samples/plots/figs/plot_matter_setupMicroLP0_SM.png
	:scale: 70 %
	:alt: map to buried treasure

	This figure shows the L=0 Landau parameters in SM for different NN interactions obtained
	from BHF calculations.

	:scale: 70 %
	:alt: map to buried treasure

	This figure shows the L=1 Landau parameters in SM for different NN interactions obtained
	from BHF calculations.
