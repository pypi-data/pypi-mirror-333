# Contributing to Posting

Posting is open to contributions! ðŸš€

Contributions of any type, no matter the "size" and form, are welcome!
Bug reports, typo fixes, ideas, questions, and code are all valuable ways of contributing.
If you're new to open source and would like a bit of extra guidance, don't be afraid to ask - we all start somewhere ðŸ˜Œ

## How do I contribute?

You can suggest ideas by creating a discussion, or report bugs by creating an issue.

If you wish to contribute code, and it's a change which is not an "objective improvement", please open a discussion first.
An "objective improvement" is a change which _indisputably_ improves Posting.
Some examples include adding test coverage, performance improvements, bug fixes, and fixing clear inconsistencies.

By opening a discussion, we can make sure:

- You're not working on something that someone else has already started.
- The feature is within Posting's scope.
- We can iron out the details before you go and commit a bunch of time to it!
- Maintainers can give you tips, and the discussion will be a place you can ask for help and guidance.
