# API Guide

This section provides a detailed overview of the Django System Monitor API, allowing users to manage resource usage
efficiently. The API exposes two main endpoints:

## ResourceUsage API

The ``metrics/`` endpoint provides the following features:

- **List resource usage**:

  Fetches all resource usages. Controlled by the ``SYSTEM_MONITOR_API_ALLOW_LIST`` setting.

- **Retrieve a resource usage**:

  Retrieve a resource usage. This feature is controlled by the ``SYSTEM_MONITOR_API_ALLOW_RETRIEVE`` setting.

---

## Example Responses

Here are some examples of responses for each action:

**List resource usage with default serializer**:

```text

- `disk_usage`: Current disk usage percentage.

- `network_sent`: Network data sent speed in MB/s.

- `network_received`: Network data received speed in MB/s.

- `disk_read_speed`: Disk read speed in MB/s.

- `disk_write_speed`: Disk write speed in MB/s.

- `disk_active_time`: Disk active time as a percentage.

---

## Throttling

The API includes a built-in throttling mechanism that limits the number of requests a user can make based on their role.
You can customize these throttle limits in the settings file.

To specify the throttle rates for authenticated users and staff members, add the following in your settings:

```ini
SYSTEM_MONITOR_AUTHENTICATED_USER_THROTTLE_RATE = "100/day"
SYSTEM_MONITOR_STAFF_USER_THROTTLE_RATE = "60/minute"
```

These settings limit the number of requests users can make within a given timeframe.

**Note:** You can define custom throttle classes and reference them in your settings.

---

## Ordering and Search

The API supports ordering and searching of metrics.

Options include:

- **Ordering**: Results can be ordered by fields such as `id`, `to_time`, `cpu_usage`, `memory_usage` or other fields.

- **Search**: You can search for fields like `id` or any other fields.

These fields can be customized by adjusting the related configurations in your Django settings.

---

## Pagination

The API supports limit-offset pagination, with configurable minimum, maximum, and default page size limits. This
controls the number of results returned per page.

---

## Permissions

The base permission for all endpoints is ``IsAuthenticated``, meaning users must be logged in to access the API. You can
extend this by creating custom permission classes to implement more specific access control.

For instance, you can allow only specific user roles to perform certain actions.

---

## Parser Classes

The API supports multiple parser classes that control how data is processed. The default parsers include:

- ``JSONParser``
- ``MultiPartParser``
- ``FormParser``

You can modify parser classes by updating the API settings to include additional parsers or customize the existing ones
to suit your project.

----

Each feature can be configured through the Django settings file. For further details, refer to the [Settings](#settings)
section.

# Usage

This section provides a comprehensive guide on how to utilize the package's key features, including the functionality of
the Django admin panels for managing resource usages.

## Admin Site

If you are using a **custom admin site** in your project, you must pass your custom admin site configuration in your
Django settings. Otherwise, Django may raise the following error during checks or the ModelAdmin will not accessible in
the Admin panel.

To resolve this, In your ``settings.py``, add the following setting to specify the path to your custom admin site class
instance

```python
SYSTEM_MONITOR_ADMIN_SITE_CLASS = "path.to.your.custom.site"
```

example of a custom Admin Site:

```python
from django.contrib.admin import AdminSite


class CustomAdminSite(AdminSite):
    site_header = "Custom Admin"
    site_title = "Custom Admin Portal"
    index_title = "Welcome to the Custom Admin Portal"


# Instantiate the custom admin site as example
example_admin_site = CustomAdminSite(name="custom_admin")
```

and then reference the instance like this:

```python
SYSTEM_MONITOR_ADMIN_SITE_CLASS = "path.to.example_admin_site"
```

This setup allows `dj-system-monitor` to use your custom admin site for its Admin interface, preventing any errors and
ensuring a smooth integration with the custom admin interface.

# ResourceUsage Admin Panel

The `ResourceUsageAdmin` class provides a comprehensive admin interface for managing resource usage records in the
Django admin panel. Below are the features and functionality of this admin interface.

---

## Features

- **ID**: The unique identifier for the resource usage record.
- **To Time**: The end time of the resource usage monitoring period.
- **CPU Usage**: The percentage of CPU usage recorded.
- **Memory Usage**: The percentage of memory (RAM) usage recorded.
- **Disk Usage**: The percentage of disk space used.

### List Display Links

The following fields are clickable links to the detailed view of each record:

- **ID**: Links to the detailed view of the resource usage record.
- **To Time**: Links to the detailed view of the resource usage record.

### Filtering

Admins can filter the list of resource usage records based on:

- **From Time**: Filter records by the start time of the monitoring period.
- **To Time**: Filter records by the end time of the monitoring period.

### Search Functionality

Admins can search for resource usage records using:

- **CPU Usage**: Search by CPU usage percentage.
- **Memory Usage**: Search by memory usage percentage.
- **Disk Usage**: Search by disk usage percentage.

### Pagination

# Dashboard

## Overview
The dashboard provides a real-time monitoring interface for system resource usage, including CPU, memory, disk, and network activity.

## Access Control
- Only authenticated users with the necessary permissions can access the dashboard.
- Ensure that the required permissions are correctly configured in your settings.

## Features
- **Real-Time Updates**: Resource metrics update dynamically at short intervals.
- **Smooth Visuals**: Animated transitions for a better user experience.
- **Historical Data**: The last few metrics are displayed for trend analysis.

## Usage
1. Navigate to the dashboard URL in your application (default: `/system_monitor/dashboard`).
2. Ensure you are logged in with the necessary permissions.
3. View real-time resource usage metrics, updated automatically.

## Short Polling
- The dashboard uses short polling to fetch updated metrics every few seconds.
- This ensures up-to-date information without overloading the server.

## collect_metrics Command

The `collect_metrics` command is designed to collect and store system resource metrics (CPU, memory, disk usage, and network usage) over a specified time period (or live if no `--until` provided). Here's the breakdown of its key functionalities:

### Command Overview

This command calculates and stores CPU, memory, disk, and network usage. The `collect_metrics` command is useful for tracking system performance and resource consumption.

### Optional Arguments

- `--until <HH:MM:SS>`:
  Defines the end time for the monitoring period in the **local time zone**. Defaults to the current time if not provided.

- `--interval_minutes <float>`:
  Defines the interval (in minutes) for collecting metrics (useful if passing `--until` for collecting average metrics in a time range) . The default value is `1` minute.

### Usage

The command can be run using Django's `manage.py` utility:

```bash
$ python manage.py collect_metrics --until 23:59:59 --interval_minutes 5
```

### Command Flow

1. **Current Metrics Collection**:
   - If `--until` is not provided, the command collects system metrics (CPU, memory, disk read/write, and network sent/received usage) for the current time and stores them immediately in the database.

2. **Timed Metrics Collection**:
   - If `--until` is provided, the command will fetch average metrics between the time of running the command and the end time passed as `--until`. For example, if you specify `--until 23:15:00`, it will start collecting metrics from the current time until 23:15:00. During this period, the command collects data at the specified `--interval_minutes` (e.g., every 2 minutes). It will then compute and store:
     - **Average CPU and Memory Usage**: The command aggregates CPU and memory metrics during the time range and saves their averages.
     - **Total Network and Disk Usage**: For network, the total amount of data sent and received is accumulated over the time range. For Disk read/write, the total amount of read and write data is accumulated over the time range, while Disk usage is stored as the last disk space value captured.


### Scheduling the Command

#### Example Using a Cron Job
To schedule the command to run every day to collect the resource usages between a specific time range, add this to the crontab:

```cron
0 15 * * * /path/to/venv/bin/python /path/to/project/manage.py collect_metrics --until 21:30:00 --interval_minutes 5
```

this will run the command every day at 15:00 , and collect the metrics every 5 minute until 21:30, and saves the average to the database.
