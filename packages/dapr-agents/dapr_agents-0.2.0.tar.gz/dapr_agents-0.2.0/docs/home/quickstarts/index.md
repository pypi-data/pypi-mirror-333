# Dapr Agents Quickstarts

[Quickstarts](https://github.com/dapr/dapr-agents/tree/main/quickstarts) demonstrate how to use Dapr Agents to build applications with LLM-powered autonomous agents and event-driven workflows. Each quickstart builds upon the previous one, introducing new concepts incrementally.


!!! info
    Not all quickstarts require Docker, but it is recommended to have your [local Dapr environment set up](../installation.md) with Docker for the best development experience and to follow the steps in this guide seamlessly.

## Quickstarts
 
| Scenario | What Youâ€™ll Learn |
| --- | --- |
