The team, led by Gandalf, approached the doors and examined the elvish inscriptions, identifying the key phrase \"mellon,\" which means \"friend\" in Elvish. This simple word reflects the historical friendship between Elves and Dwarves, and was determined to be the solution to the riddle inscribed on the doors.\n\nUpon speaking the word \"mellon,\" the doors reacted as anticipated, gliding open to reveal the passage into Khazad-d\u00fbm. This confirms the power of friendship and unity celebrated by Celebrimbor and Narvi when crafting the doors.\n\nWith the path now open, Gandalf led the Fellowship into Moria, instructing each member on their roles in the journey through the darkened halls. Legolas, with his keen senses, took the lead to scout for potential threats, and Frodo continued to bear the One Ring with determination. The Fellowship proceeds into the depths with vigilance, prepared to face the challenges ahead.",
