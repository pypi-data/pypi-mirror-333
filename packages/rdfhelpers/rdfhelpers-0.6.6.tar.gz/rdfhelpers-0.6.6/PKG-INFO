# RDF Helpers

Useful stuff when programming with RDFLib:
- Various ways to manipulate RDF graphs (shortcuts, really)
- Predefined graph transformations (e.g., containers --> repeated properties)
- Templated queries (substitution not limited to RDF terms like in RDFLib with `initBindings`)
- Templated graph creation (based on SPARQL `CONSTRUCT`)
- Journaled graphs
- Label caching
- etc.

Available to install [from PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/rdfhelpers/). Documentation can be found [here](https://rdf-helpers.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## To Do:
- More test coverage
- More predefined transformations (e.g., flat descriptions --> hierarchical descriptions)
