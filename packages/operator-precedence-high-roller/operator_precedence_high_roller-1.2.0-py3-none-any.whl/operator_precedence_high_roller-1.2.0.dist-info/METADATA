# Operator Precedence High Roller Package

This is a package for a discord bot. I call it High Roller as a play on its original use for TTRPG rolling, as well as a joking reference to gambling. Also recently I added a !gamble command to make the joke more literal.

How to run -
Enter the main directory in terminal.
python -m operator_precedence_high_roller.high_roller

Commands -

! is the general character to put before a discord message to be read by the bot.
