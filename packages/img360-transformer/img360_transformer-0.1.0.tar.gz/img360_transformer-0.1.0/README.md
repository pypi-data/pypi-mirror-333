### Command-Line Interface

To use the command-line interface, run the following command:

```

- `<pitch>`: The pitch adjustment in degrees.
- `<yaw>`: The yaw adjustment in degrees.
- `<roll>`: The roll adjustment in degrees.
- `<image1_or_glob>`: The path to the first image or a glob pattern to match multiple images.
- `[<image2_or_glob> ...]`: Additional image paths or glob patterns.

Example:

```sh
python main.py 0 -30 0 "images/*.jpg"
```

### Graphical User Interface

To launch the graphical user interface, run the following command:

```sh
python main.py <image>
```

- `<image>`: The path to a single image.
