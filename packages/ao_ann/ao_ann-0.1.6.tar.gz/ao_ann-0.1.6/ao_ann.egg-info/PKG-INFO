# American Options ANN

> This is still a work in progress, all `v0.1.*` releases are testing releases.

This is a Python package for American Options Pricing using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
that assumes the option follows a GARCH process. The package will contain 3 stages of datasets
for 3 GARCH models:

1. HN-GARCH
2. Duan-NGARCH
3. GJR GARCH


## Project Structure
- `ann.py`: Contains training and evaluation of the ANN model, as well as the main entry point for the program (`ao_ann_main(...)`)
- `loss.py`: Contains the function to calculate the different loss measures between target and predicted values.
- `model.py`: Contains the implementation of the ANN model used for pricing American Options.
- `dataset.py`: Contains parsing the CSV files and preparing the data for training and testing.
- `utils.py`: Contains utility functions for the package.


## Installation

```bash
pip install ao_ann
```

## Running Locally
