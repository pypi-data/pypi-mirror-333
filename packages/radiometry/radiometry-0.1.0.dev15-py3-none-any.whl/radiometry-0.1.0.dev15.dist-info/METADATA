==========
radiometry
==========

*Reproducible and automated processing and analysis of (synchrotron) radiometry data based on the ASpecD framework.*

Welcome! This is radiometry, a Python package for **processing and analysing (synchrotron) radiometry data** in a **reproducible** and mostly **automated** fashion. Currently, it focusses on data obtained at one of the beamlines at **BESSY-II or MLS in Berlin**, mostly operated by the German National Metrology Institute, the `Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) <https://www.ptb.de/>`_.

Due to inheriting from the `ASpecD framework <https://www.aspecd.de/>`_, all data generated with the radiometry package are **completely reproducible** and have a complete history.


Features
========

A list of (planned) features:

* Generalised data model for (synchrotron) radiometry data

* A growing list of general-purpose processing and analysis steps


And to make it even more convenient for users and future-proof:

* Open source project written in Python (>= 3.7)

* Developed fully test-driven

* Extensive user and API documentation


Installation
============

To install the radiometry package on your computer (sensibly within a Python virtual environment), open a terminal (activate your virtual environment), and type in the following::

    pip install radiometry


Related projects
================

There is a number of related packages users of the radiometry package may well be interested in, as they have a similar scope, focussing on scientific data analysis and reproducible research.

* `ASpecD <https://docs.aspecd.de/>`_

  A Python framework for the analysis of spectroscopic data focussing on reproducibility and good scientific practice. The framework the radiometry package is based on, developed by T. Biskup.

* evedataviewer

  A Python package for **graphically inspecting data** contained in EVE files, *i.e.* data **obtained at one of the beamlines at BESSY-II or MLS in Berlin**, mostly operated by the German National Metrology Institute, the `Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) <https://www.ptb.de/>`_.
