üåê Stoobly is a feature-rich man-in-the-middle proxy tool to **record and mock HTTP/HTTPS requests and responses.**

üöÄ Easily create scalable API mocks with little setup time. 

‚ö° Maintaining hard-coded inputs and responses is expensive. De-clutter your codebase and **streamline maintenance with replay and record.**

üí° Upon request interception, mocking is configurable to match against all request components.

üî® Need advanced configuration? Take advantage of features like scenarios, filters, rewriting, match rules, and lifecycle hooks.

See our docs for more detailed information! https://docs.stoobly.com
