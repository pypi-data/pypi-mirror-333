### Why EchoFire?  
- ğŸš« **Manual testing sucks**: Listening to every agent response isn't scalable.  
- ğŸ¤– **Synthetic TTS isn't real**: Simulate *actual* human speech patterns, background noise, and ASR edge cases.  
- ğŸ”¥ **Test everything**: Validate ASR accuracy, intent logic, and agent responses in one flow.  
- ğŸ’» **Works locally**: Run tests on your machine with a simple CLI - no cloud deployment needed.
- ğŸ”„ **CI/CD ready**: Integrate voice agent testing into your continuous integration pipeline.
