### Tired of Trying Harder? Ask the Sensei.

Exploit Sensei is a LLM-powered exploitation recommendation CLI.
The sensei will show you the way to penetration testing. It is not an automation tool, but enhances your ability!


## Features

- Tells you how to hack anything.
- Reads your penetration testing memo and provides recommendation.
- Levarages OpenRouter's **free** models.

## Prerequisites

- [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) API key (FREE)

## Installation

```sh
pipx install exploit-sensei
```

## Usage

### 1. Set the OpenRouter API Key

Login the OpenRouter and get the API key, and set it with the command below:

```sh
exploit-sensei set <OPENROUTER_API_KEY>
```

The API key will be stored under `~/.exploit-sensei/` directory.

### 2. Ask the Sensei

There are various ways to ask the sensei for advice.

- **Option 1. Ask with Instructions**

  When you run the following command, you will be asked some questions about the target system you will be penetration testing. By answering them, the sensei will tell you where to start.

  ```sh
  exploit-sensei ask
  ```

- **Option 2. Ask with Text**

  You can also specify text to ask specific questions.

  ```sh
  exploit-sensei ask -t "Provide 10 XSS payloads."
  ```

- **Option 3. Ask with Your Memo**

  A more advanced option is to have the sensei read your notes and give you advice.

  ```sh
  exploit-sensei ask -f memo.txt
  ```

  The format of the memo file is up to you, as the sensei leverages the power of LLM. For example,

  ```txt
  Target System Information:
    - IP Address: 192.168.1.10
    - Operating System: Ubuntu 20.04
    - Open Ports: 22 (SSH), 80 (HTTP), 443 (HTTPS)

  Test Methodology:
    - Information Gathering: Nmap scan performed on 192.168.1.10
      - Open Ports: 22, 80, 443
      - Services detected: SSH, Apache, OpenSSL
    - Vulnerability Scanning: Used Nessus for initial vulnerability scan
      - Detected Vulnerabilities:
        - OpenSSL version 1.0.2, susceptible to CVE-2016-2107
        - Apache HTTP Server misconfiguration (AllowOverride none)
  ```

  The sensei reads it and tell you some advices for further exploitation.

### 3. Specify Model

When asking the sensei with `exploit-sensei ask` command, you can choose specified model as below:

```sh
exploit-sensei ask --model "deepseek-r1-zero"
```

To see available models, run `exploit-sensei ask --help` command. 

## Notes

- OpenRouter has a limit of 200 requests per day for free models. See [the documentation](https://openrouter.ai/docs/faq#how-are-rate-limits-calculated).
