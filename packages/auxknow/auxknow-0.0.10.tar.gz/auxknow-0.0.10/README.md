## Background

At _The Hackers Playbook_, we are committed to building cutting-edge AI infrastructure and platforms grown out of Bharat (India). AuxKnow represents a significant milestone in our mission to deliver robust, developer-friendly tools for crafting AI-driven solutions. We encourage you to explore, innovate, and share your insights to help us improve and evolve.
